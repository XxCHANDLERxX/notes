###Detailed notes of Professor Bernard Wong's amazing lectures.
(Like seriously, Prof. Wong is amazing, one of the best CS profs I've had.)

I tend to write what the prof says as well as what is on the board [the course slides]. Hopefully you find them useful! I know there are quite a few typos, but if you notice any more serious errors please let me know!

Note: I missed February 9th's lecture. If anyone has notes for that class, can I haz them? :)
