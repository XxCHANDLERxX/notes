Reporting and Interpreting Non-current Liabilities

Bonds!

Recall: Stock is equity

Bonds are debt/liability (the company owes you).

Bond principle OR par value OR face amount OR maturity value
    Bond issue price if not issued at a premium or a discount.
    (The principle, if bond stated rate = market rate)

Discount
    Offered rate < Market rate

Effective interest method
    Interest expense for bond computed by multiplying carrying amount by market rate.

Premium
    Offered rate > Market rate

Debt-to-equity Ratio
    (Total Liabilities) / (Shareholders' Equity)

On Statement of Cash Flows
    Issuance of long-term debt: cash inflow from financing activities
    Repayment of principal: cash outflow
