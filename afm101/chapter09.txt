Reporting and Interpreting Property, Plant, and Equipment

Long lived assets
    Tangible
        Land - Statement of Financial Position (No depreciation - record as separate asset)
        Buildings, Fixtures, and Equipment - Statement of Financial Position (or in notes)
        Biological Assets (Animals or Plants)
        Natural Resources
    Intangible (No Physical Substance)
        Computer Software
        Copyrights
        Trademarks
        Patents

Acquisition Cost
    Based on cost principle
        All costs incurred in acquisition of long lived asset are recorded in the asset account.
        Including sales taxes, legal fees, transportation costs, installation costs.

Use, Impairment, Disposal of PP&E
    Decreciation
        All long lived assets except land have a limited lifespan.
        We must depreciate the acquisition cost over the useful life.
        A process of cost allocation, not calculating market worth.

        Dr Depreciation Expense (Expense)
            Cr Accumulated Depreciation (Contra Asset)

        Carrying Amount (AKA Book Value) = Acquisition Cost - Accumulated Depreciation
            Appears on Statement of Financial Position.

    Calculating depreciation expense
        Involves acquisition cost, estimated useful life, estimated residual/salvage value.

        Straight Line Method
            Depreciation Expense = (Cost - Residual Value) / (Useful Life)

        Units of Production Method
            Depreciation Expense =
                ((Cost - Residual Value) / (Estimated Total Units)) * Units Produced

        (Double) Declining Balance Method
            Depreciation Expense = (Cost - Accumulated Depreciation) * (2 / (Useful Life))
                                 = (Carrying Amount) * (Declining Balance Rate)

    Changes in Depreciation Estimates
        Distribute difference between carrying amount and new residual value,
         over the rest of the new remaining useful life.

    Impairment
        Carrying Amount > Recoverable Amount
        (expected future cash flows) > (market value less cost to sell)

    Disposal
        When a company voluntarily decides to let an asset go before end of useful life.
        Journal Entry:
            Cost of asset and accumulated depreciation removed,
             Record difference between carrying value and resources gained from removal of asset as gain or loss on disposal of the asset.
        This gain or loss is recorded as revenue or expense in peripheral/incidental activites.
