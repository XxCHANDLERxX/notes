3a1 Vision

    Cornea

    Pupil

    Iris

    Lens

        Inverts the image, flashes image onto retina upside down

    Fovea

        Point of central focus on retina

    Retina

        Cross-section: 3 cells thick

            Outer: ganglion cells

            Middle layer: Bipolar cell

            Back: Rods (smaller ones) and cones (bigger ones)

                Rods are responsible for black and white

                Cones are responsible for colour

                Light must go through the two cell layers above before getting
                to the rods and cones, to protect them.

                The rods and cones fire to give visual signals (neural impulses)
                to the brain.

    Optic nerve to brain's visual cortex

        Takes signals from retina and transmits them back to the brain

    From eye to the cortex (visual cortex at the back of the brain)

        Nerves cross left-right, pass through visual area of the thalmus, and
        go to the visual cortex at the back. They cross over at the "optic
        chiasm".

        The process of turning light into shapes is "feature detection".

        In the cortex, there are individual cells that respond to lines at
        various angles.

        The brain then takes the symbols of lines to create a pattern.

        Cells converge to create our perception of what we see

        Higher level cells provide even more perception

        All of this happens virtually instantaneously

        This is all done with a massive parallel processing of information,
        currently unmatched by modern computers and arteficial intelligence

        It is still not completely understood as to how the visual cortex
        organizes all this information

    Colour vision

        How do we see all of these different colours and know what they look
        like?

        Two main theories:

            Young-Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory

                Comes from primarily studying the retina

                Three types of cones in the retina, which respond to three
                types of light; primary colours red, green, and blue
                (like a colour printer ink cartridge).

                All other colours can be made from these three

                Could just the specificity of the cones produce these different
                colours?

                Consistent with this theory are colourblind individuals

                    Red and green - problem with either green or red cones

                    Blue and green - no distinction between blue and green cones

                Theory works well until we alk about the colour yellow, which is
                only really explained as another primary colour on its own.

            The Opponent-Process Theory of Colour Vision

                There are actually three sets of opposing pairs of colours

                    Black and white (rods and cones)

                    Red and green

                    Blue and yellow

                "Things that respond to yellow don't respond to blue, etc."

                Afterimage effect

                    Opposing colours are left behind

                    Fired neurons get "worn out", so when we look at a sheet of
                    paper after staring at something, the reverse neurons fire
                    as if we are seeing the opposing colours.

                    Like a teeter-totter

            Both of these theories are probably true, but in different areas of
            the brain. At the retinal level, you have the three types of cones
            which work together to produce all the different colours.

            Opponent-process is probably true in the thalmus, higher up in the
            brain as it is processing things.

3a2 Hearing

    Outer Ear

        Pinna (outermost fleshy disk)

        Auditory canal (hole in the middle of the pinna)

        Eardrum (back of auditory canal)

            Vibrates like the top of a drum

    Middle ear

        Three bones transmit the eardrum vibrations mechanically

        Vestibular sacs for balance

    Inner ear

        Stirrup attaches here and vibrates the cochlea

        Cochlea turns physical stimulus into neural impulses
            
            Like the retina of the ear

        Auditory nerve (coming out of the cochlea)

    Closer look at the cochlea

        Fluid "sloshes" through basilar or cochlear membrans protruding hair
        cells - nerve fibers to auditory nerve

        Sound waves -> eardrum -> hammer -> anvil -> stirrup -> oval window
        -> cochlea

        How does this fluid get turned into a neural impulse?

            Place theory

                Particular hairs determine pitch

                Big waves are going to hit back a lot further creating one pitch
                (lower sounds, because low sounds make big waves).

                Higher sounds are going to make smaller waves, which land closer
                in

                This theory can't explain the ultra-high sounds we cannot hear
            
            Frequency theory

                The speed of the waves determine the pitch

                Big waves go slower, and little waves go faster

            Both theories seem to be true

            Place theory works well for high pitch sounds, and it is the
            particular hairs that matter

            Frequency theory explains low sounds, it is the frequency of the
            waves pushing lots of hairs at once to create a richer, fuller sound

3a3 The Other Senses - Taste, Smell, Touch, Pain, and Balance

    Taste

        Four basic tastes - sweet, sour, salty, bitter

        Tongue has tastebuds that respond to these different tastes

        Taste sensations are created by chemical reactions on the taste buds,
        rather than a physical reaction as in sight and hearing

        Taste is also heavily influenced by smell

        Together they respond to much of the same stimuli 0 this is called
        sensory interaction

        Often what enhances the flavour of the food is the smell rather than
        the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter

    Smell

        Also a chemical sense

        Occurs due to a chemical reaction in the olfactory membrane that creates
        smell

        We still don't know exactly how olfactory membrane receptors work

        There are a tonne of different smells - way more than the 4 taste combos

        Chemical in the air gets picked up by these receptors in the olfactory
        membrane which creates a neural impulse

        Odors can powerfully evoke memories and emotions

            Why?

            Nasal passage -> receptors in olfactory membrane - situated right
            next to limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala)

    Touch

        "We know less and less as we go down this list of senses."

        Organ for touch is skin

        There are specialized nerve endings in the skin, but these don't seem
        to have a relationship with what we feel - it's not an easy mapping

        Our skin is sensitive to pressure, warmth (not hot), cold, and pain

        These four sensitivities give rise to quite varied sensations

            e.g. A tickle

                Hard to explain why ticklishness is dependent on having it done
                by someone else

        The sense of touch doesn't map onto the physical sensation nearly as
        much as some other senses

        Hot = warm + cold, an interesting physical illusion

        Wet = cold + pressure

        Itchiness = overstimulated pain receptors

    Pain

        More is known about pain, but it is increasingly difficult to understand

        No definable area of the brain that is related to pain

        Memories tend to be of the magnitude of the pain, but not the duration

        Gate control theory

            Suggests that the spinal cord has a neurological gate that either
            blocks pain signals or allows them to travel to the brain

            Distractions close the gate and make pain more manageable

            Brain is blocking out the pain response with lots of other responses

            Endorphins, which are the body's natural pain killers, may shut that
            gate right at the spinal cord so those signals can't get to the
            brain

    Balance

        AKA kinesthetic sense

        Feeling of being disoriented or fuzzy

        Seems to occur through two very different sense organs

        The joints and muscles tell us our body's position

        Also the semi-circular canals in the ears tell us the vestibular sense
        of balance and orientation, particularly for the head

            Grains of sand rolls around on hairs in the vestibular
