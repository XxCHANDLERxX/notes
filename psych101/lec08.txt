8a Clinical Psychology I: Psychology Disorders

    Five different classes of disorders

        Anxiety Disorders (Phobias)

        Mood Disorders (Depression, Bipolar Disorder)

        Psychotic Disorders (Schizophrenia)

        Dissociative Disorders (Multiple Personality Disorder/Dissociative
        Identity)

        Personality Disorders

        Book - DSM-IV categorizes disorders - first axis is the first four
        things, personality disorders are a separate, second axis

8b Anxiety Disorders

    Phobias

        Irrational fear of something you really don't have to be afraid of

        Fairly common condition

        Story about prof's son - scared of dogs, even small terrier, for some
        reason

        Very treatable

        Graph of phobias and scary things - 40% Very afraid of snakes, etc. vs
        "bothered slightly" vs "not at all afraid of it"

        People's phobias are logical - snakes can be poisonous, claustrophobia
        can suggest death from suffocation

        People aren't scared of driving cars, for some reason.

    Generalized Anxiety Disorder - Panic Disorder

        Overwhelming sense of anxiety

        Not localized as being caused by a particular thing

        Can become quite debilitating

        Associated with panic attacks (with panic disorders)

            e.g. Agorophobia - fear of open placesm being outside

             - Some cases where people stayed inside for 20 years

    Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

        Can vary from mildy to extremely obsessive and debilitating

        16 year old boy worried about germs everywhere

        Washed his hands about 2000 times a day

        Would spend all of his time washing his hands but neglecting the rest
        of his body, pooping his pants, etc.

        Repetitive thoughts - boy thinking that he is being poisoned

        Repetitive behaviours - checking things over and over again - a few
        times isn't debilitating, but a few hundred times can be

        Obsessions (repetitive thoughts):
            
            dirt/germs/toxins: 40% (among children/adolescents with OCD)
            something terrible happening: 24%
            Symmetry, order, exactness: 17%

        Compulsions (repetitive behaviours):
        
            excessive handwashing, bathing, grooming: 85%
            repeating rituals (in/out of door, chair): 51%
            checking doors, locks, appliances, brakes, homework: 46% 

    Lots of ways to treat anxiety disorders

        Psychanalytic perspective - therapy

            Solves some deep lying problem which is causing the disorder

            Freud's Little Hans case study

                Developed his ideas about Oedipus complex

                Little Hans was very afraid of horses

                Freud only talked to Hans' parents

                Debilitating phobia back then - horses everywhere

                Freud believed that Little Hans had anxiety arising from Oedipus
                complex transferred onto horses; terrified that the father might
                castrate him; horses have large penises and wear blinders, like
                his father's glasses
        
        Learning perspective

            Thinks people gain phobias like Little Albert - being afraid of
            small, furry animals

            Anxiety gained by associating stimuli with something aversive

            Can generalize from one thing to another

            Treatment via unconditioning, e.g. virtual reality training

            OCD - dealt with by rewarding people for not doing their compulsions

        Social cognitive perspective

            Observational learning

            Developed certain phobias by watching others and observing what they
            are afraid of

                e.g. Prof is slightly uncomfortable with dogs -> his son is
                afraid of them

            Use models who are doing non-fearful  behaviour to help overcome the
            fear

        Biological perspective

            OCD can be treated by drugs in some cases

            Phobias fall into natural categories over hsitory - inborn
            biological fears
            
8b) Mood Disorders

    In particular, depression.

    Major Affective Disorder

        AKA unipolar depression
        Profoundly depressed and lasting over six months
        Can interfere dramatically with your life
        Fairly common, and pretty treatable

        Other symptoms:
            - poor appetite
            - insomnia
            - feeling worthless
            - loss of interest in others
            - sleeping 14-15 hours a day (or insomnia)
            - weight gain due to lack of activity
            - persistant
            - clear thoughts of suicide "almost all people who commit suicide
              have depression"

    Bipolar Depression

        Seen as a more extreme version of unipolar depression.
        Used to be called manic depression.
        Extreme highs and lows
        Low side is major affective disorder or unipolar depression
        High side is euphoric, grandiose, feeling unstoppable

        e.g. Patiient's baseball story

            "I was quite good, semi pro, eventually made the major leagues,
             won three games as a pitcher. Also I was the top ace in the U.S.
             military and got to meet the president. Then I decided to run for
             president, and I became the president. Then, I decided to become
             god! I still am god!"

        Negative side of euphoria - easily agitated, can be violent, reckless,
        risk-taking, wasting money

        A number of famous people who have been manic depressive - Winston
        Churchill, poets.

        Pressured speech - words being pushed out before they are even fully
        formed. Usually someone in this state is bouncing off the walls with
        energy and not sleeping.

        Rate of mood change:
         - Rapid cycling (hours/days)
         - Months, or even years
         - Seems to vary within people

        Women suffer from depression more than men (10% of 18-24 year olds vs
        5% for men).
        Men are more likely to kill themselves than women, though.

    Explanation of Mood Disorders

        Psychoanalytic perspective
         - depression is anger turned inward
         - part of the therapy is to express your anger at the appropriate
           target

        Biological perspective
         - strong genetic influences - both unipolar and bipolar disorders run
           in the same family
         - certain neruotransmitters there seems to be a depletion in depressed
           individuals - in particular, noradrenalin and seratonin
         - drugs that elevate the levels of noradrenalin and seratonin are
           effective anti-depressants
         - do the highs and lows of bipolar balance out eventually?
            - probably not
            - may be due to poor regulation of neurotransmitters in the synapse
            - neruotransmitter levels may sometimes be too high, and sometimes
              too low

        Social cognitive perspective
         - treatments combine drugs with social cognitive approach are most
           affective
         - attributions for failure as internal, stable, or global
            - internal: it's my fault
            - stable: it's always going to be this way
            - global: it will affect my whole life
         - vicious cycle of negative thoughts/moods
         - therapy can break this vicious cycle

8d Psychotic Disorders - Schizophrenia

    Thinking is scattered; people don't make any sense.

    Disorganized thinking
    Delusions - beliefs that are provably false but they still believe it
    Often delusions of persecution, e.g. "the CIA is spying on me"
    Disturbed perceptions
     - auditory hallucinations (hearing voices/sounds that aren't there)
     - inappropriate emotions and actions
        - catatonia - can be posturing
        - emotions not matching the situation
     - social withdrawl
        - don't like spending time with people or having anything to do with
          others
     - flat affect
        - no emotion/responsiveness
        - monotone voice

    Types of Schizophrenia:
     - Paranoid (preoccupied with delusions/hallucinations)
     - Disorganized (speech, behaviour, or emotions)
     - Catatonic (immobility, negativism, parrotlike repeating of others)
     - Undifferentiated (catch-all; many and varied symptoms)
     - Residual (withdrawl, after hallucinations/delusions disappeared)

    Two types of symptoms that stand out:
     - positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations)
     - negative emotions (social withdrawl, inappropriate emotions, and flatness
       or affect)

    Explanations of Schizophrenia

        Psychoanalytic perspective
         - focus on unconscious
         - Freud believed unconscious was irrational
         - he thought that schizophrenia was the overflowing of the irrational
           unconscious

        Biological perspective
         - genetic influences
         - brain neurotransmitters (dopamaine)
         - one schizophrenic twin means the other has a 50% chance of having it

        Social cognitive perspective
         - Stress Diathesis Model
         - suggest schizophrenia is a combination of two things
         - genetic predisposition is combined with stress experienced

8e Dissociative Disorders - Multiple Personalies

    Note: very different from schizophrenia.
    Consciousness can be divided, can lose sense of who they are
    Fugue State
     - a person disappears and becomes someone totally different
       "woke up and started a new life"
     - skeptics say that individuals may just be purposefully leaving their life
       behind
     - never the same person at the same time

    Dissociative Identity Disorders
     - one body can be different identities, often in threes
     - Three Faces of Eve - Eve White, Eve Black, and Jane
       "Went through fifteen sets of three personalities."
     - is this real?
        - some say this is a real, serious problem
           - there are distinct patterns of brain activities
           - seen as a way to cope with anxiety
           - may be a result of abuse or trauma as a child
             "being different people in order to cope"
        - some say it isn't real
           - social phenomena created by hypnosis in therapy
           - between 1930-1960 there were two cases per decade
           - in the 1980s there were 20000 cases

8f Personality Disorders

    Traditionally seen as a very different type of disorder; classified
    differently by psychiatrists (medical doctors).
    Difficulty getting along wiht other people.
    Ranges dramatically.
    Most prominant/important: Antisocial Personality Disorder
        - Almost as if they have no conscience
        - Can commit brutal acts
        - Can be very charming or charismatic
        - Many famous mass murderers have antisocial personality disorders
        - Not upset/aroused by acts that hurt other people, etc.
        - Coherent thinking; seem normal

    Histrionic
     - 95% diagnosed are women
    Narcissistic
     - 80% diagnosed are male
    Borderline personality
     - mostly women

    All three above:
     - impulsive
     - dramatic
     - dramatic style of relating to others
     - can't get along with other people
     - tend to be strongly disliked

    Avoidant Personality Disorders
     - high anxiety and social withdrawl
     - nowadays would be said to have social phobia

    Schizoid Personality Disorder
     - mild form of schizophrenia
     - eccentric behaviour
     - classified by social withdrawl, magical thoughts

    Classifications of Personality Disorders
     - Antisocial: destructive people, no conscience
     - Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Borderline: terrible ways of interacting
       with others
     - Avoidant and Schizoid: weak forms of other disorders
