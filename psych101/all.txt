1a Introduction to Psychology

    Psychology has a great breadth

    Psychology isn't merely common sense, but often we thought the opposite of
    what is true.

        e.g. Opposites don't attract.

    Psychology isn't about unethical studies, animal torture, etc.

        Since the late 1960s much care is taken to remain ethical.

    Animal sacrifice can still be done, but it is rarer nowadays.

    Now, much research on the brain is done on humans, with machines that can
    take pictures.

    A way to think about psychology:

        It has to do with what people think; it's about the thoughts that are
        in our heads.

        Historically, some thought that 'thoughts' should not be part of
        psychology.

        It also has to do with how we feel about things, our emotions, and
        motivations.

        Reactions, emotions, thoughts, and such are often not aligned.

            e.g. Getting too nervous to ask someone out.

        Psychology is also about how you act.

        So, three main areas: thoughts, feelings, and actions.

History of Psychology

    1b1 The Three Beginnings of Psychology

        Who do we think is the first psychologist?
            1. Freud
                The psychiatric tradition
                Contributed important contribution to the beginnings of
                psychology
                Started psychoanalysis
                Tradition more represented in medicine nowadays
            2. Testing tradition
                Seen most heavily in intelligence testing
                Developed in England
                Sir Francis Galton, a first cousing of Charles Darwin
            3. Academic approach (laboratory psychology)
                Wilhelm Wundt
                    Set up the first psychology laboratory
                    Wundt is interesting for his failure
                    Scientific approach
                    Chemical - 'mental atoms' of thoughts
                William James
                    A student of Wundt's and a contemporary of Freud's
                    Made much ley progress
                    Brought psychology to North America
                John B Watson
                    Early proponents of behaviourism
                Gestalt pschologists in Europe

    1b2 The Psychiatric Tradition

        Dominated by Freud

            Had a very complex theory about the way the psyche worked
            Two primary motives driving people - sex and aggression
            Much of what drives our behaviour is unconscious
            Huge inner mental life that we are unaware of which is very complex
            and very devious

            One of his most famous, whacky ideas - Oedipus complex.

                Influenced much of adult development.
                Was the central problem to human psyche.
                "As children boys want to have sex with their mother, and in
                realizing that this is not possible, vicariously live this
                through his father's sex life with the mother."
                Didn't explain how women developed at all.

        Carl Jung

            Incredibly brilliant
            More important for his literature
            His psych theories not taken very seriously

        Carl Adler

            Had different ideas from Freud
            Adler believed that people wanted to be powerful and in control
            Echoed in modern psych via self esteem

        Ego Psychologists

            Followed in the Freudian tradition and have made an important impact
            on modern psychology.

            Erik Erickson - model of social development
            Karen Horney and Henry Stack Sullivan - focused on the importance of
            relationships in developing the self-concept.
            (Social psych, social psych of relationships very contemporary.)

        Major assumptions of the psychiatric tradition

            Cannot rely on what people say or do to indicate anything, because
            most mental life is unconscious.

                Less emphasis on what people tell you, but on the interpretation
                of what is said.

            Emphasis on understanding each individual person comprehensively.

                Studying one person at a time and knowing all details.

                Most research done in the psychiatric tradition has been through
                therapy over a number of years

                Understanding the individual comprehensively as a whole

            The best approach is a clinical approach

                More is learned by people who are sick than those who are
                healthy, and by doing therapy. That tells you more about what
                is hidden beneath the psyche, what is really going on.

    1b3 the Testing Tradition

        Charles Darwin

        Sir Francis Galton - Darwin's cousin

            Naive idea of how to study what makes people "fit".
            What makes people geniuses?
            Underlying elitism/aristocracy - some people were better than
            others.

            Conencted his ideas to Darwin's theory of evolution.

            Assumed smartest people were those who were the most fit.

            Believed the first measure of intelligence was physical tests.
            (Following a spinning disk, riding a bike fast.)

            "A miserable failure. But a brilliant Mathematician!"

        Spearman

            Student of Galton, developed many new important statistical
            techniques.

            Factor analysis - way of figuring out what goes together.

        Cattel & Eysenek

            Students of Spearman
            Famous in the trait tradition
            Two different views ended up creating similar model
            Two major components to personality:
                1. Introversion vs Extroversion
                2. Neuroticism vs Mellow

        Binet

            First to figure out how to actually perform an intelligence test.

            Covered topics one would learn at school.

            Trying to figure out age/grade level.

            Very similar to what we now think of as school testing.

        Major assumptions of the testing tradition

            1. Psychology is primarily a product of biology

                 Emphasis on nature over nurture

                 If you want to know what people are about, study the
                 evolutionary basis of behaviour.

            2. There are only a few ways in which people differ

                There are only a small number of traits which can explain how
                people differ

            3. People's traits can be understood through simple tests.

                Questionnaires and paper and pencil tests make up almost all of
                the research in this tradition

    1b4 The Academic Tradition

        Wilhelm Wundt

            Psychological atomism

            Would have people come in and tell him about a thought that they
            had had; introspect

            Thought he would get a nice periodic table of "psychological atoms",
            but it made no sense

        William James

            Pragmatism

            Believed Wundt was wrong for not studying what people really cared
            about

            Pragmatic approach - study things that are meaningful to people

            Still important in North American psychology

            "What does this matter?" is an important question.

        Watson & Skinner

            Took the approach of behaviourism, which dominated NA psych for
            about 40 years

            Believed that Wundt was not scientific enough, studying thoughts
            which cannot be observed

            If we need to be scientific, we need to study something observable,
            like behaviour.

            Defined psychology as the scientific study of behaviour.

            Made progress in a number of different domains

        Kurt Lewin

            European

            Gestalt psychology

            Argued that Wundt made a wrong assumption, that the whole does not
            equal the sum of its parts.

            This was a powerful perspective.

            Many times the parts don't add up to the wholes that we see and come
            to know and understand.

        Major assumptions

            Psychology is best understood when the causes are understood
                
                We need to understand what causes a behaviour

                The why is more important than the how or the when

            People's thoughts and actions can be understood.

                Thoughts and actions are not outside of the individual, are not
                irrelevant.

                By observing people, we can understand them

            Systematic study produces the fullest understanding

                Labs were set up

                Wundt's lab - how long does it take to press a button?

                    Reaction time

    1b5 Three New Beginnings in Psychology

        In the 1960s and 70s, these traditions each had a rebirth

        The Psychiatric Tradition

            Humanistic Approach "Third Wave"
            
                First was psychiatric
                Second was behaviours

            Carl Rogers

                What Rogers tried to do in his therapy was very different from
                the pschoanalytic tradition

                He reflected back to the individual what they were feeling

                Belief that people are basically good, and if you let them get
                in touch with themselves and understand themselves they will get
                better

                They need to get in touch with this good inner part of who they
                are
            
        The Trait Tradition

            Expanded to 5 from 2 traits - OCEAN

                Openness = intelligence
                    
                    Open to new experiences -> more education, more flexible
                    thinking

                Conscientiousness
                
                    people who stick to their goals and work to get things done

                Extroversion

                    (Above)

                Agreeableness

                    How positive or negative of a person are you

                Neuroticism

                    (Above)

        The Academic Tradition

            The cognitive revolution

                In the 60s and 70s there was growth and changes from
                behaviourism to cognitive psychology

                Study of thought is one of the primary and important things
                about people

                Albert Bandura - observational learning

                It became clear that with behaviourism, there was much that
                could not be explained

                We can learn by observing people rather than just being
                reinforced ourselves

                Changed the face of psychology

    1c1 Basic Philosophy of Science

        (Behind research methodologies of psychology.)

        Big questions behind research methodology

        Focus on academic tradition

        Other traditions do not necessarily feel the same way

        Our ideas can be wrong

            "Healthy skepticism"

            "I know my idea can be wrong"

            We set out to demonstrate that our ideas are wrong

                Only draw firm conclusions when we have shown that the idea is
                wrong

            We accept an idea when we can't prove that it is wrong

                "The textbook should not be read as fact, but as a bunch of
                ideas we haven't disproved yet."

                This doesn't protect the idea from being disproved in the future

                Good to have healthy skepticism when reading the text

            We might prove everything wrong later!

                True in all branches of science, including physics.

        A number of things influence these ideas.

            What is accepted is often what is popular rather than the data.

            Also shaped by political forces and social influences.

    1c2 Ways of Doing Research

        Tension between discovery and explanation

            When something is discovered and is brand new, does it mean
            anything?

            Some sciences are mostly about explanation; how things work, how
            things unfold (like chemistry).

                Astronomy is more abour discovery.

            Psychology is in the middle - new discoveries, but explanation is
            important

            Different traditions have different emphasis on discovery and
            explanation

            Psychiatric tradition uses mostly case studies in its research.

        Freud's famous case study - Anna O

            Freud was Anna's therapist for many years
            Developed an unusual sickness after a couple of years of caring for
            her sick father
            Was blind even though nothing was physically wrong with her
            Also had glove paralysis - paralysis of her left hand.

                Strange - it should be numb all the way up her arm!

            Freud believed that Anna was having fantasies about sex with her
            father, and that was the cause of her problems.

            Many modern psychologists feel that Anna was being sexually abused
            by her father

            Freud thought her tales of abuse were part of her fantasy

        Naturalistic observation

            Similar to case study but usually broader

            Observe, watch, and see what happens

            Jane Goodall's research with chimps

            Not very often done with people

        Survey research

            Question a sample of the population

            Goal is to find out what the whole population is like

            Want to represent the whole population from just a sample of people

            Establishes generality

            Sets up correlations between variables

                When one thing happens, another thing tends to happen

            Correlation between children watching violent tv and being violent

            Can randomly sample children throughout all of Canada to find out
            how much ciolent tv they wathc

            Then, find out how often they use violent behaviour

            What you find is a nice, reliable correlation between the two

        Correlation doesn't mean causation

            Just because kids who watch violent tv tend to be violent doesn't
            necessarily mean that the tv caused the kids to be violent

        Experiments

            Usually about establishing causation

        Example of correlation established by survey research

            One possibility is that the violent television causes the violent
            behaviour, but what is really going on?

            Maybe its that violent kids like to watch violent tv

            Whenever you have a correlation, you have to think about which
            direction it goes in. Does A cause B or does B cause A?

            Or maybe a third thing causes both behaviours - abuse?
            Hyperactivity?

            Maybe it's education? Parent's background?

            There is always the possibility of having many variables when you
            have a correlation

            Causation establishes which one it is, which pattern is right

    1c3 Research Methods - Surveys & Establishing Representativeness

        Representative group of people

        You want the people filling out the survey to correspond to the larger
        group that you want to generalize and represent

        Random sampling

            On surveys

            Survey a subset of a large group of people

        Random assignment

        Surveys must also be unbiased

            Anchoring effects

                Give people something that you know is wrong but influences the
                way they interpret the question

                Is the Mississippi river longer or shorter than 500 miles? How
                long is it?

                Will actually give a short estimate because they are still
                influenced by the 500, even though that info is wrong.

                People given that question gave answers ~2000 shorter.

                Given X terrible incident, is capital punishment justified?
                Given the legislative slowness behind capital punishment, is it
                justified?

            Framing effects

            Surveys do a good job of establishing correlation between variables

    1c4 Correlation is not Causation: How do you establish causation?

        Correlation
            
            When one variable changes, the other variable changes as well

        Time order

            Know which "cause" comes first

            Longitudinal research - over time.

                e.g. Asking about tv usage/violence now then 3 years later

        Elimination of all other possible causes

            Were their parents more aggressive?
            Did they come from poor families?
            Were the children who were more aggressive likely to be hyperactive?

            Experiments do this by random assignment

                Randomly assign people to various conditions

                Take a small group in an experiement, and randomly have one half
                do one thing and the other half do another.

            Independant variable

                What we think is going to be the cause
                Experimental group - watches television
                Control group - doesn't watch television

            Dependent variable

                Behaviour that you are concerned with in the end; the effect
                Have children play together to see if they will fight

                We want the dependent variable to be:

                    Valid - measures what it is supposed to measure

                    Reliable - get the same outcome every time

                e.g. Violent tv variable needs to measure violence, like
                fighting. This is valid, but not reliable - kids don't always
                fight the same amount.

                Reliable = highly clustered data in the same place of a target
                Valid = hitting the bullseye

                Time order is built in

                    Independent variable leads to the dependent variable

            Random assignment eliminates other causes via probability theory.

Lecture 02: Behavioural Neuroscience I

2a The Nervous System and the Brain

    Neuron

        Basic cells making up the nervous system

    Peripheral nervous system

        All the other nerves that run through the body which are not the brain
        or the spinal cord

    The central nervous system and the brain

        Is probably one of the frontiers we understand the least in psychology

    The endocrine system

        Hormones

        The different chemicals that float through the blood and also influence
        us

    Putting it all together - hunger example

        Not separate systems, they all work together (e.g. with hunger).


2b1 The Neuron

    Picture - neuron

        Myelin sheath

            Little globule things - not present on neurons iside the brain

            Lets the electric current bounce from node to node so the impulse
            can travel quickly - impulses/reflexes faster than our brain

            Neurons part of the peripheral system and spinal cord actually work
            faster than in the brain

        Dendrites

            Branchy things found at the "back end" of the neuron

        Axon

            Branchy terminal things

        Action potential
        
            Neural impulse moves from back dendrites to the front axons

        Cell body

            Surrounded by the dendrites

            The cell's life support centre

    How do you take a piece of tissue, like a cell or neuron, and have it
    conduct electricity

        Studying sea slugs - they have large neurons

    Inside the neuron is chemical ions of one charge flowing in and out of the
    cell membrane is what creates electricity and causes it to flow down the
    neuron.

    Where two neurons come together - Axon bumping into cell body/dendrites of
    another cell - is a synapse.

        There is a synaptic gap between the sending neuron's axon terminal and
        the receiving neuron's body/dendrite.

        A litle chemical flows between the two - neurotransmitters.

        There are lots of potential connections - a whole bunch of synapses
        "vote" towards firing the signal.

        Some of those neurotransmitters make it a lot more likely for an impulse
        to start, and some make it less likely. Add them all together to decide.

        After the neurons dump their neurotransmitter, how do they get used
        again?

            They transfer back after a short while - reuptake.

    There are lots of different types of neurotransmitters.

        Dopamine
            
            Very common, especially in the brain

            Important in two remarkably different disorders:

                Parkinson's disease

                    Partially caused by deficiency of dopamine

                    Marked by tremors

                    Important in the coordination of movement

                Also important in attention and emotion

                Schizophrenia

                    Marked by an excess of dopamine in various parts of the
                    brain.
        Seratonin

            Involved in mood, hunger, sleep, and arousal

            It affects things widely in the brain

            A deficiency of seratonin is a cause for insomnia

            Deficiencies are also associated with depression

            Prozac, Zoloft - eases to depression

        Norepinephrine

            More related to alertness and arousal

            Also associated with depression

            Older depression drugs used this

        Acetylcholine

            The most common neurotransmitters

            Involved in muscle movement

            Alzheimer's Disease:

                The nerurons that work through acetylcholine get ruined with
                Alzheimer's.

            Also involved in learning and memory

        Endorphines (a whole class of neurotransmitters)

            Involved in pain regulation

                When injured, the body releases these to handle more pain

            Heroine and morphine mimic this neurotransmitter.

2b3 How Drugs Affect Neurotransmitters

    Drugs mimic the shape of a neurotransmitter

    The real transmitter fits really well

    Agonist mimic the neurotransmitter with "2/3 shapes"

    Antagonist block neurotransmitter - it gets in the way.

    So, some drugs work like the neurotransmitter (for deficiencies), while
    others block to reduce an excessive amount.

2c Divisions of the Nervous System

    Nervous system - all the neurons in the body

        Central - brain and spinal cord

        Peripheral

            Somatic - controls voluntary movements of skeletal muscles

            Autonomic - controls self-regulated action of internal organs and
            glands, like pupil dilation

                Sympathetic - arousing - "gets you ready for fight or flight"

                Parasympathetic - calming - "lets you build up all your energy"

2c1 The Peripheral Nervous System

    Autonomic nervous system

        Controls the glands

        Controls the muscles related to our organs

        Possible to regulate with conscious thought, but often spontaneous

            e.g. hiccups

        Sympathetic nervous system - arousal - often stress

            Pupils dilate - see more
            Heartbeat accelerates
            Stomach - digestion is inhibited
            Stimulates glucose release by liver
            Adrenal gland - burst of adrenaline
            Kidney - stimulates secretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine
            Bladder relaxes
            Stimulates ejaculation in male

        Parasympathetic - calming - eating and sleeping
        
            "classic thanksgiving afternoon"

            Pupils contract
            Heartbeat slows
            Stimulates digestion
            Stimulates gallbladder
            Contracts bladder (gets bigger)
            Stimulates erection of sex organs (part of sleep cycle)

2c2 The Central Nervous System

    The spinal cord

        Carries information from the peripheral nervous system up to the brain

        Does some "thinking" in controlling some responses

            Typically refered to as reflexes

            Contains some neurons that cannot only transmit things, but can
            route things different ways, almost making some primitive decisions.

    The Spinal Cord - a simple reflex

        What happens if you put your finger in a flame?

        People usually pull their finger out immediately.

        The decision is made within the spinal cord. It has things called
        interneurons that can "flip a switch" to contract motor neurons directly

        You can override these things with your brain

    The Brain

        Does almost all "processing"

        Three areas of the brain we need to know about

            Brainstem

                Controls all vital functions

                Injury often leads to death

                Very crucial

            The lymbic system

                Controls motivation and emotion

                Very important for memory

            Cerebral cortex

                The bulk of our brain

                Much larger than in animals

                Separates us from animals

        The Four Parts of the Brain Stem

            Medulla

                Absolutely critical in keeping us alive

                Controls the heartbeat and breathing

                On top of the spinal cord - common reason for death by broken
                neck.

                Damage = fatality!

            Reticular formation

                Controls attention, alertness, reactivity

                Can be thought of the accelerator of the brain

                Basic function that regulates the overall amount of brain
                activity

            Thalamus

                Sensory switching point

                Crucial for vision and other senses

                Beginning processes of our senses come about here

            The Cerebellum - cannopy-looking thing under the brain

                Crucial for movement and coordination of movement

                Crucial for balance

                Big in birds

            The Lymbic System - odd shaped grouping of things around brain stem

                Hypothalmus
                
                    Crucial for hunger

                    Controls the hormones of the Pituitary gland

                    Some influence on other emotions as well, particularly
                    pleasure

                Amygdala

                    Important for a number of things, including anger

                Hippocampus

                    Crucial for memory and for laying down the functions of
                    memory

                    Damage can cause severe types of memory loss

            The Cerebral Cortex - basic divisions

                Back part: Occipital lobe

                    Heavily involved in vision

                    Damage can blind - even with working eyes

                Top-back: Parietal lobe

                    Language and facial recognition

                    Lots of things

                Lower around the ear: Temporal lobe

                    Involved in hearing, memory, and mood

                Front: Frontal lobe

                    Important in reasoning and thinking

                    Close to half of the cortex

                    Complex processing of information

            The Cerebral Cortex Functional Divisions - Movement and Sense of
            Touch

                Motor Cortex

                    laid out like a body - toes to trunk to fingers to neck
                
                    left hemisphere section controls the body's right side

                Input: Sensory Cortex

                    left hemisphere section receives from the body's right side

                Motor and sensory are separated by a big groove

                If there is a seizure - too much electrical activity in the
                brain - they convulse if it goes through the motor cortex.

                Epillepsy can happen that misses this - seizures without
                convulsing.

                Stroke can also paralyze here.

                Often movement and touch are both lost, since they are so close.

            Hearing and vision

                Visual cortex - very back of brain

                Auditory cortex - processed right next to ear

                    Damage here can cause deafness with no possibility of
                    correction.

            Left and Right side of the brain

                Left side controls right side of body and vice-versa

                Corpus Callosum - big thick area connecting both sides, for
                exchanging information

                Epileptic study in the 1950s - lots of seizures is very bad, so
                they went in and cut the corpus collosum - cutting the two sides
                of the brain apart.

                This helps to reduce the number of seizures dramaically because
                the electrical impulses do not spread to the other side.

                Odd behaviour was then discovered - the two sides of the brain
                actually perform different functions.

                Left side is more verbal and able to process language

                Right side is better at visual processing and coordinating, and
                can only understand simple language

                Caveat: Left-handers have a brain structured like this, but some
                are reversed.

            Mike Gazanaga Study - helps explain "executive" function of the
            left brain, the ability to explain and interpret what is going
            on.

                Brain is able to do this even when it is wrong

                Right brain can process visual stimuli, and process commands

                When he would flash "get up" to the right side, a number of
                people would get up, and could instantaneously rationalize
                their behaviour.

                Left side is good at rationalizing.

                Would the right side of the brain be better at picking up what
                emotion is being shown on a face?

2d The Endocrine System

    Hypothalmus - brain region controlling Pituitary gland

    Pituitary gland - secretes many different hormones, some of which affect
    other glands

    Testes/Ovaries - secrete male/female sex hormones

    Affects Adrenal glands - inner part, the medulla, helps trigger the fight or
    flight response

    Pancreas - regulates insulin, blood sugar

    Parathyroids - help regulate the level of calcium in the blood

    Thyroid gland - affects metabolism, energy level, weight gain

    Is usually longer term - hormones stick around in the blood stream and keep
    going and going. Short term stuff is usually from the nervous system.

2e Putting it All Together - The Case of Hunger

    When we don't eat for a while, what makes us feel hungry?

    Stomach contractions - carry hunger signal trhough the peripheral nervous
    system to the hypothalmus

    But if we drink lots of water to prevent these contractions, we still feel
    hungry.

    Blood sugar levels interpreted and controlled by the liver and pancreas to
    send a message to the hypothalmus

    Lateral hypothalmus is stimulated and releases the hormone orexin which
    heightens hunger

    fMRI (functional MRI) - shows lateral hypothalmus very active when hungry

    When we eat:

        Stomach expands and this message is transmitted to the hypothalmus

        Blood sugar levels as interpreted and controlled by the liver and
        pancreas send messages of higher levels to the hypothalmus

        Insulin is also released

        Ventromedial hypothalamus is stimulated and leads to the feeling of
        satiation, so we stop the eating

        (This is a simplified, strictly physiological version!)

    Damage to the hypothalamus - rats starve to death, feel lethargic/depressed.

    Damage to ventromedial - rats never stop eating and become enormous

2f Overarching principles

    Lots of specificity, or specialization of function in specific parts of the
    brain.

    However, it's not that simple.

    The whole structure of the brain work together in coordinated, overlapping,
    and redundant systems

        e.g. Anger passes through frontal lobe - we can reason about our
        reaction

    The systems act at the same time to influence hunger

    We can't say THAT part controls THAT one thing

    Despite the specificity and complexity, the brain has lots of plasticity

        If one area is damaged, other areas can take over

            e.g. Prof's daughter had hydrocefilus - bleed in the brain - and
            didn't do any lasting damage despite significant immediate damage.

3a1 Vision

    Cornea

    Pupil

    Iris

    Lens

        Inverts the image, flashes image onto retina upside down

    Fovea

        Point of central focus on retina

    Retina

        Cross-section: 3 cells thick

            Outer: ganglion cells

            Middle layer: Bipolar cell

            Back: Rods (smaller ones) and cones (bigger ones)

                Rods are responsible for black and white

                Cones are responsible for colour

                Light must go through the two cell layers above before getting
                to the rods and cones, to protect them.

                The rods and cones fire to give visual signals (neural impulses)
                to the brain.

    Optic nerve to brain's visual cortex

        Takes signals from retina and transmits them back to the brain

    From eye to the cortex (visual cortex at the back of the brain)

        Nerves cross left-right, pass through visual area of the thalmus, and
        go to the visual cortex at the back. They cross over at the "optic
        chiasm".

        The process of turning light into shapes is "feature detection".

        In the cortex, there are individual cells that respond to lines at
        various angles.

        The brain then takes the symbols of lines to create a pattern.

        Cells converge to create our perception of what we see

        Higher level cells provide even more perception

        All of this happens virtually instantaneously

        This is all done with a massive parallel processing of information,
        currently unmatched by modern computers and arteficial intelligence

        It is still not completely understood as to how the visual cortex
        organizes all this information

    Colour vision

        How do we see all of these different colours and know what they look
        like?

        Two main theories:

            Young-Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory

                Comes from primarily studying the retina

                Three types of cones in the retina, which respond to three
                types of light; primary colours red, green, and blue
                (like a colour printer ink cartridge).

                All other colours can be made from these three

                Could just the specificity of the cones produce these different
                colours?

                Consistent with this theory are colourblind individuals

                    Red and green - problem with either green or red cones

                    Blue and green - no distinction between blue and green cones

                Theory works well until we alk about the colour yellow, which is
                only really explained as another primary colour on its own.

            The Opponent-Process Theory of Colour Vision

                There are actually three sets of opposing pairs of colours

                    Black and white (rods and cones)

                    Red and green

                    Blue and yellow

                "Things that respond to yellow don't respond to blue, etc."

                Afterimage effect

                    Opposing colours are left behind

                    Fired neurons get "worn out", so when we look at a sheet of
                    paper after staring at something, the reverse neurons fire
                    as if we are seeing the opposing colours.

                    Like a teeter-totter

            Both of these theories are probably true, but in different areas of
            the brain. At the retinal level, you have the three types of cones
            which work together to produce all the different colours.

            Opponent-process is probably true in the thalmus, higher up in the
            brain as it is processing things.

3a2 Hearing

    Outer Ear

        Pinna (outermost fleshy disk)

        Auditory canal (hole in the middle of the pinna)

        Eardrum (back of auditory canal)

            Vibrates like the top of a drum

    Middle ear

        Three bones transmit the eardrum vibrations mechanically

        Vestibular sacs for balance

    Inner ear

        Stirrup attaches here and vibrates the cochlea

        Cochlea turns physical stimulus into neural impulses
            
            Like the retina of the ear

        Auditory nerve (coming out of the cochlea)

    Closer look at the cochlea

        Fluid "sloshes" through basilar or cochlear membrans protruding hair
        cells - nerve fibers to auditory nerve

        Sound waves -> eardrum -> hammer -> anvil -> stirrup -> oval window
        -> cochlea

        How does this fluid get turned into a neural impulse?

            Place theory

                Particular hairs determine pitch

                Big waves are going to hit back a lot further creating one pitch
                (lower sounds, because low sounds make big waves).

                Higher sounds are going to make smaller waves, which land closer
                in

                This theory can't explain the ultra-high sounds we cannot hear
            
            Frequency theory

                The speed of the waves determine the pitch

                Big waves go slower, and little waves go faster

            Both theories seem to be true

            Place theory works well for high pitch sounds, and it is the
            particular hairs that matter

            Frequency theory explains low sounds, it is the frequency of the
            waves pushing lots of hairs at once to create a richer, fuller sound

3a3 The Other Senses - Taste, Smell, Touch, Pain, and Balance

    Taste

        Four basic tastes - sweet, sour, salty, bitter

        Tongue has tastebuds that respond to these different tastes

        Taste sensations are created by chemical reactions on the taste buds,
        rather than a physical reaction as in sight and hearing

        Taste is also heavily influenced by smell

        Together they respond to much of the same stimuli 0 this is called
        sensory interaction

        Often what enhances the flavour of the food is the smell rather than
        the combination of sweet, sour, salty, bitter

    Smell

        Also a chemical sense

        Occurs due to a chemical reaction in the olfactory membrane that creates
        smell

        We still don't know exactly how olfactory membrane receptors work

        There are a tonne of different smells - way more than the 4 taste combos

        Chemical in the air gets picked up by these receptors in the olfactory
        membrane which creates a neural impulse

        Odors can powerfully evoke memories and emotions

            Why?

            Nasal passage -> receptors in olfactory membrane - situated right
            next to limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala)

    Touch

        "We know less and less as we go down this list of senses."

        Organ for touch is skin

        There are specialized nerve endings in the skin, but these don't seem
        to have a relationship with what we feel - it's not an easy mapping

        Our skin is sensitive to pressure, warmth (not hot), cold, and pain

        These four sensitivities give rise to quite varied sensations

            e.g. A tickle

                Hard to explain why ticklishness is dependent on having it done
                by someone else

        The sense of touch doesn't map onto the physical sensation nearly as
        much as some other senses

        Hot = warm + cold, an interesting physical illusion

        Wet = cold + pressure

        Itchiness = overstimulated pain receptors

    Pain

        More is known about pain, but it is increasingly difficult to understand

        No definable area of the brain that is related to pain

        Memories tend to be of the magnitude of the pain, but not the duration

        Gate control theory

            Suggests that the spinal cord has a neurological gate that either
            blocks pain signals or allows them to travel to the brain

            Distractions close the gate and make pain more manageable

            Brain is blocking out the pain response with lots of other responses

            Endorphins, which are the body's natural pain killers, may shut that
