10a Social Psychology I: The Power of the Situation

Kurt Lewin and his two classic statements
 - behaviour is a function of the person and the situation
 - there is nothing wuite so practical as a good theory

Conformity and Obedience (in Nazi Germany)

Bystander Intervention (Why do people not do anything when someone needs help?)
 - often the opposite reasons of what you would expect

10b Kurt Lewin and His Two Classic Statements

Kurt Lewin
 - the father of the field of social psychology
 - most people in the field can trace their training back to him
 - very eclectic psychologist
 
 1. Behaviour is a function of the person and the situation.
  - the power of the situation must be examined alongside behaviour
  - that statement has been fundamental in the understanding of social
    psychology
  - most people think that they are not controlled by the situation
  - social psychologists believe that most people can be treated the same and
    are affected in the same way by the situation

  2. There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory
   - approach of social psychology is that you need to have a good theory about
     what is going on to understand and do something about a problematic
     situation
   - concerned with real issues that have a powerful affect on people

10c Conformity and Obedience

The Sherif Norm Formation Study
 - wanted to understand how people came to have a certain set of beliefs and
   why these are shared throughout society
 - Sherif thought of these beliefs as norms
 - took advantage of a perceptual illusion called the Autokinetic Effect
    - pinpoint of light fixed on a dark room wall looks like it is moving,
      since the movement of our eyes is hard to sense, it looks like it's
      moving
    - asked people how much the light moved
    - people's estimates become consistant over time
    - people with estimates placed in the same room tend to equalize their
      estimates
    - groups of people ended up giving a census estimate
    - a confederate was thrown into the group to give a really small number
      or a really big number, swaying the consensus

The Solomon Asch Conformity Study
 - was a Jewish contemporary of Lewin who also fled Nazi Germany
 - thought that he would find more conformity in Germany than in the US
 - would people say that long was short if pressured by conformity?
    - everyone looked at three lines and picked the standard line on their own
    - but when 7 people before you say 'line 3' (the shorter line), people
      changed their answers
    - 70% of people in the study gave the wrong answer at least once
    - so, almost everyone went with the group, despite unambiguous stimuli

The Stanley Milgrim Obedience Study
 - felt that Asch's study did not explain the horrendous acts of Nazi Germany
 - tested whether people would obey authority
 - will people commit acts of cruelty just because they are told to?
    - subjects are told that electric shocks will help people learn
    - teacher instructs student to shock a confederate who gets small shocks
      and acts nervous; acts in pain
    - most subjects went to 300 volts (confederate goes silent)
    - 63% of subjects keep going to 450 volts
 - conclusion: we are a lot more susceptible to social pressure and obeying
   authority figures than would be recognized
 - psychiatrists estimated less then one tenth of one percent would have done
   it
 - women and men both come out to 63%
 - Situation is very powerful. Why?
    - person feels trapped; they agreed to do this
    - only do 15 volt steps each time
    - experimenter doesn't make it easy for the subject to stop
 - very controversial study; led to ethics review boards
 - only one of 40 regretted being in this experiment

10d Bystander Intervention

Kitty Genovese (1968)
 - viciously attacked outside her apartment building
 - 23 people were woken up and heard her scream, each one heard her,
   but police weren't called until after the crime was done
 - common sense notion was that new yorkers just didn't care

Latane and Darley
 - wanted a theory to understand this
 - most people believe safety in numbers
 - Latane and Darley believe that the more people that are around,
   the less likely they are to help
 
 Smoke filled room study
  - 55% report smoke in their room when alone
  - 12% report the smoke when in a group of three
 
 The Seizure Study
  - set up so that no one else is there to respond
  - man fakes a seizure
  - likelihood of someone helping is a direct, negative relation
    of how many other people are available to help
  - "breaking down on a lonely road is better than a busy one"
 
 Model of Helping
  - learning this phenomenon makes it less likely to happen
  - to help, someone must:
     - notice the incident
     - interpret the incident as an emergency "everyone tries to be cool"
     - assume responsibility "it's my job to help" "diffusion of 
       responsibility"
  - once someone attempts to help, there is a conformity effect
    - one person seeing the incident as an emergency cues others to come
      and help
