 - Kinsey (biological approach)
 - Masters and Johnson (studied people having sex)
 - culture and sex

Achievement Motivation
 - what drives people to get ahead in life
 - intrinsic motivation (doing something because you want to, not to please or
   to make money)
 - leadership styles

The Psychology of Health
 - stress and disease
 - maintaining good health

12b The Psychology of Sex

The Kinsey Report
 - Kinsey was a biologist at the University of Indiana
 - wanted to understand more about sex, and what people thought about it
 - interviewed 18000 people about sexual practices
    - only people who were willing to talk about it
 - in the 40s and 50s, this may be a reflection of those who were a little more
   free with their sexual attitudes
 - Kinsey had a unique way of asking questions, assuming people had done things
   to force a yes
 - "people were pretty kinky"

Research from last 10 years reflects a better estimation of sexual behaviour
 - random sample of population (e.g. census)
 - make sure that it's completely anonymous
 - more representative surveys suggest people are more boring than Kinsey
   suggested
    - over 75% surveyed have never had an affair while married
    - Kinsey had reported that about 80% of men and 50% of women had
      extramarital affairs
 - people still do a number of different sexual activites, but not as common as
   Kinsey had suggested

Masters and Johnson's Study of the Sexual Response Cycle (50s)
 - wanted to know what happened to people when they were having sex
 - what physiological responses people experience, and how do they describe that
   experience
 - had subjects have sex in the lab while hooked up to wires for 
   physiological readings
 - findings are now common knowledge

    Sexual Response Cycle
     - excitement phase
        - bodies change, blood pressure rises, changes in the sexual organs
     - plateau phase
        - building up the excitement; blood pressure continues to rise
     - orgasm
        - something that people did not talk about; debates about womens'
          orgasms
     - resolution phase
        - coming down, relaxing, body returns to normal states

 - findings have been helpful for people with people who have sexual problems
 - problems can be divided into different phases, and corrective excercises can
   be created

Culture and Sex

    Media images and satisfaction of partners
     - how does a man feel about his partner when he looks at pictures of a
       beautiful woman?
        - true for both genders: seeing beautiful images of someone else makes
          you less satisfied with your partner
     - one of the big changes in society is the availability of these images

    Changes in sexual practices across cultures and times
     - percentage of children born to unwed mothers
        - western world: rising! (5% in 60s to 30-40% in 2000)
           - girls enter puberty ~2 years than they used to (average age is 12)
           - average age of marriage has gone up dramatically
           - in 2001 the average age of marriage was 30.5 for women and 32 for
             men, including second marriages
           - for first marriages, it's 28 for women and 30.5 for men
           - provides more opportunity for premarital children
           - married women are giving birth to much fewer children
           - attitudes have changed significantly from the 60s to the 2000s
        - Japan: flat, near zero!

12c Achievement Motivation

Two types of achievement motivation:
 - extrinsically driven by the rewards one will receive
    - reading 1000 pages and get pizza, kids!
 - intrinsically driven because one really wants to do it

Daycare Magic Markers Study - Lepper, Greene, and Nisbett (1973)
 - brought kids magic markers
    - control condition: "colour with these markers if you want to"
    - second condition: "if you draw a nice picture, you will get a reward"
    - third condition: a surprise reward after drawing a picture

 - a week later, magic markers were put out
    - finding: rewards wreck intrinsic motivation
       - least playtime with expected reward group
       - surprised award group had little impact

    Basic principle - when people know that they are going to be rewarded for
    something ahead pf time, they don't know if they are doing it because they
    reward it.

    Promised rewards undermine people's intrinsic motivation.

Building Intrinsic Motivation
 - Mom: "I'll give you $5 for every A."
    - Child: "As long as she pays, I'll study." (extrinsic motivation)
 - Mom: "Your grades were great! Let's celebrate by going out to dinner!"
    - Child: "I love doing well!" (intrinsic motivation)

Leadership Style

Fiedler's research on task and social leadership
 - wanted to see which leaders were good leaders
    - e.g. Bobby Knight - a tyrant, tolerates no shenanigans
    - e.g. more social leaders - involved, interested, makes people happy
 - which type of leader gets the most out of their players?
    - social leader is usually better overall, but
    - if the team is terrible, the task-oriented leader does the best, or
      if the team is really good (pushes them the extra mile)

12d The Psychology of Health

Placebo Effect
 - works for high blood pressure, heart attacks, angina
 - Journal of the American Medical Association (Fall 2001)
    - argues that the placebo effect is overblown
    - studies forgot to take into accoun the regression to the mean
    - when regression to the mean is taken into account, placebo effect is often
      smaller
 - known to be useful in helping people deal with pain
 - when people think they are getting pain medication they seem to do better

Stress
 - understanding of stress and how problematic it can be for our physical health
   has driven health psychology
    - e.g. prof stressed out about taking care of kids and cooking thanksgiving
      dinner; wife stressed out much differently about her mom's potential death
 - general adaption syndrome "very biological reaction"
    - phase 1: alarm reaction (mobilize resources)
    - phase 2: resistance (cope with stressor)
    - phase 3: exhaustion (reserves depleted)
 - control is important
    - if there is a feeling of control, the situation is much less stressful
       - e.g. executive rat that can spin a wheel to avoid getting shocked
         doesn't get sick and die
    - the appraisal of the situation is crucial in determining the level of
      stress
       - stressful event
          - appraisal: Threat "Yikes, this is beyond me!"
             - response: panic, freeze up
          - appraisal: Challenge "I've got to apply all I know."
             - response: aroused, focused
 - feeling of panicked stress negatively impacts the immune system
    - Lymphocytes don't work as well
    - increased cholesterol
    - more prone to cancer and heart disease

Promoting Health - Do's and Dont's
 Do's:
 - getting lots of exercise
 - relaxation
 - best reducer of stress and the best predictor of health is having lots of
   social support

 Don'ts:
 - don't smoke or overeat
