11a Social Psychology II: The Perceiver Shapes Reality and the Interaction of
    the Person and the Situation
    
    Three basic units:
     - the power of the situation
     - the power of the person "the perceiver shapes reality"
        - fundamental attribution error "why someone did something"
        - stereotyping "a distortion of reality"
        - self-fulfilling prophecies "believing it makes it true"
     - the interaction of the person and the situation
        - the two factor theory of emotion
        - cognitive dissonance theory
        - prof's research: stereotype threat

11b Fundamental Attribution Error
    
The Origin of Fundamental Attribution Error
 - study from a group of psychologists, in particular Fritz Heider
 - brought a Gestalt tradition
    - the whole isn't the sum of its parts, etc.
 - the whole not equal to the sum of its parts is most relavent to understanding
   other people
 - person perception is a natural extension from the perception of objects

When you perceive somebody, how do you decide what type of person they are?
 - Heider focused on the idea that seeing a behaviour invokes the question,
   "why did they do it?"
 - dispositional attribution - attributing behaviour to the person
    - "I punched him because I'm a mean person."
 - situational attribution - behaviour influenced by the situation
    - "I punched him because he dissed my mother."
 - what is the reason for the person's behaviour?

What do people do when they see someone engage in a behaviour?

Jones and Harris Study (1967)
 - subjects read pro or anti-Castro essays (after Cuban missile crisis)
 - the situation was that either the individual chose to write the essay or
   they were given no choice
    - does the produced essay reflect their real attitudes?
       - according to attribution theory, "I don't know".
 - being forced to write a pro-Castro essay didn't make people more pro-Castro
 - people would assume that they wrote it because that's the type of person
   they are, despite being forced to write that essay
    - this is the fundamental attribution error

The Ross, Amabile, and Steimetz Game Show Study (1977)
 - one person was the "host", the other is the contestant
    - "people assume Alex Trebek is smart"
 - questioner got to pick 10 things that they thought they knew and somebody
   else would be unlikely to know (in the public domain)
 - there were also observers watching the "game show"
 - since the "host" was chosen by chance, the two people should be similar
 - contestants even believe that the host is smart

"The behaviour engulfs the field"
 - behaviour (figure) stands out; the situation is ground
 - the focus on the person attributes the behaviour to them
 - culture plays a big role; a lot stronger in western cultures
    - emphasis on independance and autonomy; people make their own choices
    - eastern cultures emphasize harmonious relations and responibilities
       - easterners more sensitive to the situation

11b2 Stereotyping
 - based on a certain characterization of what members of a specific group
   are like
 - some stereotypes are acceptable (e.g. lawyers)
 - other stereotypes are less acceptable (e.g. ethnicity)
 - lead to an expectation of what we think people are going to be like,
   and we tend to read that into their behaviour
 - particular content will be read into their behaviour

Study by Darley and Gross (1983)
 - people come in and act as a teacher
 - watch 9 year old Hannah take a standardized test
 - Hannah's performance is baffling - mixed bag of hard and easy
   questions correct
 - asked to determine how smart Hannah is
 - stereotype set up - Hannah picked up in front of a huge mansion vs.
   a trailer park
 - half of the subjects judged how smart she was before watching her 
   performance, after just watching the video
 - expectations were much higher for "rich" Hannah, especially after seeing
   her confusing test performance

The automatic activation of stereotypes affects evaluation - Devine (1989)
 - people sometimes rely on and use stereotypes without even being conscious
   that they are
 - Devine wanted to see if activating a stereotype about people of colour,
   without knowing it, could affect the evaluation of a person whose race is
   unknown
 - submiminally primed with stereotype-related words flashing on the screen
 - asked to read a story about Donald, a jerk
 - asked, "how aggressive is Donald?"
 - when primed with African American stereotype, people saw Donald as more
   agressive, despite their level of prejudice
 - presumably it would also affect evaluation of meeting a person of colour
   in real life

UWaterloo study by Sinclair and Kunda (1999)
 - subjects gave an oral presentation where they pitch themselves to a job
   position
 - the person evaluates the manager who is either black or white, with 
   positive or negative feedback
 - people dislike the manager more after negative feedback if they are black
 - "we use the stereotype to reach our desired conclusions"

11b3 Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
 - the prophecy fulfills itself
 - the prophecy, the beliefs, creates its own reality and makes it happen
 - e.g. thinking the stock market will crash leads to people withdrawing
   their money, crashing the stock market

The Pygmalion Effect in the Classrom - Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968)
 - the belief that someone can become good and successful will become
   good and successful
 - five children picked at random from a number of elementary classes
 - teachers told that they are late bloomers, soon-to-be geniuses
 - these children ended up doing better
 - the expectation of the teacher of them to become smarter actually makes
   them smarter
 - how does this happen?

Self-Fulfilling Prophecies in Dating - Snyder, Tanke and Bersheid (1977)
 - men and women asked to meet a stranger over the phone
 - had fake portfolios of what the other person was like
 - the men were given all the same information, the only difference was in
   the manipulated photograph of the woman that they believed they were
   speaking to
 - videotaped each talker separately; asked people how they behaved
 - men were a lot nicer to the women they thought were attractive
 - what is assumed is that attractive women are more desirable, friendlier,
   and nicer
 - the "what's beautiful is good" stereotype
 - would that stereotype create its own reality?
 - women's responses were the start of the self-fulfilling prophecy
 - women seen as unattractive responded less kindly

Model for Creating a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

    1. Perceiver's expectations
    2. Perceiver's behaviour toward the target
    3. Target's behaviour toward the perceiver

11c1 The Two-Factor Theory of Emotion

Early Models of Emotion

    William James
     - believed that emotions are experienced because we act a certain way
     - e.g. running from a bear makes you scared
     - reaction is first physiological
    
    Cannon and Baird argued the opposite
     - first understand it, then that leads to the emotional reaction
    
    Two Factor Theory
     - parts of both of these arguments
     - physiological arousal AND cognitive interpretation of the physiological
       arousal
     - the two factors are the physiological arousal, and the cognitive 
       arousal
     - theory argues that emotions stem from physiological arousal
        - e.g. sweating, heart pumping, etc.
     - cognitive label supplied to arousal to determine emotion
       - sweating => scared OR excited?
     
Anger and Your Mother Study - Schacter and Singer (1962)
 - wanted to see how psychological arousal together with a label, could
   go together to create the emotional reaction of anger
 - told subjects they were studying vision
 - shots given; told they will be aroused or not aroused
 - 1/3 were given a placebo
 - asked to complete a questionaire with another person
 - confederate gets angry
 - how many men has your mother had sex with other than your father?
    - 4-6, 6-10, 20 or more
 - questions also asks the subjects to rate their feelings
 - people with physiological arousal but no explanation
    - they used the explanation from the situation
    - these people had heightened anger
 
The Attraction and the Bridge - Dutton and Aron (1974)
 - high, rickety bridge (arousing)
 - attractive and unattractive woman meets a guy on the high bridge or
   a low bridge
 - asked to complete a questionaire
 - physiological arousal - misinterpreted as being caused by attraction
   for the woman? (given her number)
 - independant variable - do they call her?
 - physiological arousal + high bridge = love! (label)
 - low bridge, no physiological arousal = not as attracted
 - way more guys called her after meeting on the high bridge (50%) vs
   the low bridge

11c2 Cognitive Dissonance Theory
 - between 1962 and 1967, it dominated social psychology by far (90% of 
   studies!)
 - theory developed by Leon Festinger (mot famous of Lewin's students)
 - Festinger wanted to understand what happens when we have thoughts that
   don't go together
 - thought much of our psychology is making sense of these conflicting
   thoughts
 - argued that we get uncomfortable/anxious when thoughts don't fit
   together, which motivates us to make the easiest change to erase the
   conflict

Participant Observation Study - Festinger and Schacter
 - found out about a cult
 - they predicted that the world was going to end
 - sold their houses when told that only the followers will be saved
 - Festinger predicted what would happened to this cult
 - what happens to these people when the world doesn't end?
    - conflicting cognitions
    - rationalized that their cult had saved the world rather than being
      misguided

How much money would it take to get you to lie? - Festinger and
Carlsmith (1959)
 - had subjects asked them to turn pegs on a board for half an hour
 - experimenter explains that they want you to tell the next participant
   that it was a fun experiment
 - offered $1 or $20 to agree to do this
 - control => not fun
    - no dissonance
 - $20 => still not very far
    - money explains discrepancy "I did it for the money"
 - $1 => very fun
    - conflicting thoughts => you decide that it WAS fun

Model of Cognitive Dissonance
 - enjoyable
    - no external reward
       - self-perception: "I do this because I like it"
          - intrinsic motivation
    - external reward
       - self-perception: "I do this because I'm paid to"
          - extrinsic motivation
 
 The fact that you lied cannot be changed, or at least not without
 changing how you feel about the task.

The Role of Arousal in Cognitive Dissonance - Zanna and Cooper (1974)
 - cognitive dissonance interpretation is unique because conflicting
   thoughts cause arousal, anxious, nervous, and upset
 - uses two factor theory to connect arousal to Cognitive Dissonance
 - most students don't like tuition increases
 - had subjects compose an essay which was supposedly submitted to the
   Board of Governors as an argument for the tuition increase
 - in other condition, an illusion was created that people had a choice
   about doing it - high choice condition
    - board member pleads to class that they desperately need support for a
      tuition increase, but told they are free to choose
 - applied another level to the study so that they had high and low choice,
   but also took a pill
 - pill was said to cause arousal or calming
    - arousal from dissonance could be blamed as the pill
    - "placebo; made of jello"
    - high dissonance from calming pill - changed their attitude a lot

11c3 University of Waterloo Research Focus - Stereotype Threat
 - prof's research!
 - stereotype existing undermines that group's performance
 - even if they don't believe the stereotype, they worry about portraying or
   confirming the stereotype

Intellectual Test Performance and Group Differences - A Bit of History
 - group differences on intellectual test performance has been a contentious
   issue
 - some of the early intelligence tests justified certain groups of society
   being above others - Eugenics Movement
 - has effected immigration policies in Canada and U.S.
 - group differences may actually be about the stereotypes than they are about
   actual differences in ability or potential

Demonstrating the Effect of Stereotype Threat on Intellectual Test Performance -
Spencer, Steele and Quinn (1999)
 - looked at stereotype threat and women's performance on Math tests
 - some told there are no gender differences on this test, so gender is now
   irrelavent
 - some told there are gender differences, but not about the direction of the
   bias; it is assumed that men do better
 - When told about gender differences, men scored a bit higher than usual (26%),
   and women scored significantly lower (7%).
 - When told there are no gender differences, men and women scored about the
   same (19% vs 17%). 
 - There is a substantial detriment being caused by the concern about gender
   differences and having to worry about confirming the stereotype.
 - When told a test is under construction and non-diagnostic of their ability,
   minorities score much better.
 - In post-communist Poland, women were encouraged to do Math and were impacted
   less by the stereotype threat.

The Impact of Stereotypic Commercials on Women's Math Performance - Davies,
Spencer, Quinn and Gerhardstein (2001)
 - watching stereotypic commercials don't affect men's performance, but
   negatively affect women's performances

The Impact of Stereotypic Commercials on Women's Career Aspirations - Davies,
Spencer, Quinn and Gerhardstein (2001)
 - had subjects watch stereotypic commercials and rate desire to enroll in
   different majors, and different careers, before and after watching
 - dip in quantitative careers after watching stereotypic commercials for
   women, and rise in verbal careers
 - no affect on men
 - neutral commercials have no affect
