Clinical Psychology II: Therapies - The Big Picture

    Some disorders are easier dealt with than others
    
    Anxiety disorders
     - often cognitive behaviour therapies and phobias
     - almost 50% (85% of new) therapists are CBT

    Mood disorders
     - major depressive disorder; medication and therapy

    Schizophrenia
     - medication therapy

    Evaluating therapies
     - is therapy effective?
     - if so, why?

9b Anxiety Disorders

    Phobias
     - extremely high success rate in therapy
     - usually treated with cognitive therapy
        - e.g. Calmly looking at a picture of a spider from a distance, work up
          to a toy spider. eventually a live spider. Systemmatic desensitization
          that slowly exposes you to the phobia.
        - cognitive => thoughts trying to be controlled (peaceful, calming
          thoughts)
        - behavioural => a behaviour being done

    Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

        Getting people to engage in behaviours that will help them out while
        using their thoughts to encourage and develop those behaviours

    More serious anxiety disorders
     - Agorophobia, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder
     - Usually treated with a combination of drug therapy and cognitive therapy

9c Mood Disorders

    Usually treated with both CBT and medication

    Cognitive therapy for depressions
     - recall that people tend to make a catastrophe of all events in their
       lives
     - so we focus on the negative thoughts that depressed people have
       "it doesn't have to ruin your life"
       "when your kids get in trouble, it isn't your fault"

    Depression scores
     - cognitive training patients are much less depressed (3 months?)
     - people who are waiting got marginally less depressed
     - (each without drugs)
     - 15-20% of people seeking therapy are experiencing major depression
        - don't respond to drugs or therapy
        - often become suicidal
        - can turn to Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT) "shock therapy"
           - in 40s and 50s this was used as a punishment
           - anesthesia is used, and electric current is applied to only
             one half of the brain
           - still very controversial/debated; we don't understand how it works
           - number of shocks varies per person

    30-40% with depression will get better without any treatment in 6-9 months.

    Bipolar Disorder

        Primarily treated with medication (Lithium)

    Schizophrenia

        Primarily treated with medication

        Doing therapy with someone who isn't making sense is too hard

    Group therapy is often included with Bipolar/Schizophrenia

        Allows you to deal with the stigma of having a mental illness

        The stigma can control poeples' expectations

        Can even affect how poeple are treated/viewed within mental hospitals

    On Being Sane in Insane Places - Study by Rosenhan

        Participant observation study

        Had a group of graduate students go to a mental institution claiming
        that they were hearing voices

        Of 15 graduate students, 14 were admitted and 11 were diagnosed as
        schizophrenic

        It took the mental health professionals weeks to figure out that these
        individuals were not suffering from schizophrenia - 9 of 15 had to tell
        them the truth first

        Writing notes observing the hospital were interpreted as paranoid
        behaviour

        This shows hwo strong the expectations of being crazy can colour other
        peoples' views

        Also shows that best intentions can lead to difficulties

        Therapies and treatments may not always be of benefit to the individual,
        and that there is room for improvement

9e Evaluating Psychotherapies

    Memory and hypnosis - suggested that hypnosis could create false memories,
    bad things that didn't really happen

    Therapies must be evaluated to ensure that they will help

    Do psychotherapies really help people?

9e1 What does it mean for therapy to be effective?

    Does the person get better? How do you decide?
    Should the patient decide if the therapy is effective or not?
    When people want to get better they will say they are better even if they
    aren't

    e.g. UW's flawed study skills workshop

    What about the word of the therapist's word?
     - motivated to see improvements
     - motivated by career reputation

    Have a pre-test and a post-test; measure at the beginning and at the end.
     - Not so easily accomplished
     - Spontaneous remission: some people get better without assistance
     - most people will coem in for therapy when they are at their worst

    Regression to the mean
     - statistical problems
     - any score is partly based on chance, and partly based on real measurement
       of what you are trying to measure
     - high depression scores reported initially due to distress
     - scores trend downwards even if there is no change in depression

    What does this mean? How do we fix it?
     - common to provide a standard, proven treatment and also try a new
       treatment thought to be more effective
     - often a setup the patient is concerned about
     - that behaviour is a progress indicator

9e2 Focus on UW Research on Therapy Effectiveness

    Research by Johnathan Oakman on Social Phobias
     - social phobics are afraid of interactions with other people
     - all clients recieved medication therapy
     - three conditions
        - control: guided self help; 16 weekly therapist meetings
        - standard CBT: done in group
        - CBT with technology; use of videotaping of interactions and role play
          "I must've looked so nervous... oh wait, I looked normal!"

     - at the beginning and at the end they introduced a new social interaction
     - the result showed all three conditions work to the same degree
     - mean time of social phobics here was 18 years

     What does this mean?
      - you need to make the case that therapy is effective, and show that it is
        cost effective

9e3 Is Psychotherapy Effective?

    Across the spectrum, the answer would be yes, but not by a huge amount.
    [Two bell-shaped curves of outcomes; therapy bell translated right quite a
     bit]

    80% of untreated people have poorer outcomes than the average treated person

    Are some therapies better than others?
     - studies show that one deos not seem better than the other
     - a couple studies show that certain therapies are better for certain
       disorders (like systemmatic desensitization for phobias)
     - experience and education seem to have little affect on ability of a
       therapist

    What makes therapy effective?
     - seemingly just the personal interaction with somebody else; a personal
       relationship
     - gives people a sense of optimism and hope
