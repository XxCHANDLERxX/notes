Summary
    Shell Review
    I/O Redirection/Piping
    Regular Expressions and grep

Just typing 'cd' returns you to home directory
'ls' - "let's see"
sort wordcollection - sorts wordcollection
sort -r wordCollection | uniq -c
    prints uniqueness count of each word
head - returns first 10 lines of the file
tail - returns last 10 lines of the file
    tail -n 5 for last five words
    tail -n +5 leaves out last five lines

Classic > Redirection
    ./printer > printer.out 2> printer.err
    ./printer > out 2> out   Doesn't work, overwrites first out!
    ./printer 1> out 2>&1    Prints everything, but err is printed first! (Not buffered)
    ./printer >/dev/null

    Order of redirection matters!
    ./printer 2>&1 1>out    Doesn't redirect err to file, since 1 is currently the screen.

    sort wordCollection | uniq -c | sort | tail > topten

Regular Expressions! \o/
    ^ - start of line
    $ - end of line
    . - matches any char
    ? - matches previous item 0 or 1
    * - matches prev item 0 or more
    + - matches prev item 1 or more
    [] - matches one of
    [^] - matches anything except
    expr1|expr2 - matches one of expr1 or expr2

    egrep -n "count" *.c    Finds occurences of 'count' in all files, along with line numbers
    egrep "^a$" /usr/share/ddict/words
    egrep "^a.*z$" /usr/share/ddict/words
    egrep "^a.z$" /usr/share/ddict/words
    egrep "(^a)|(z$)"    Begins with an 'z' or ends with a 'z'
    egrep "^[^aeiouAEIOU]*$"
    egrep "([aeiou].*)([aeiou].*)+"        At least two vowels
    egrep "^ *count *= *((0)|(1) *; *$" *.c         Any amount of whitespace within code

End-of-lecture tips:
    :1000        Jumps to line 1000
    :0            Jumps to top of file
    :$            Jumps to end of file
    /int        Search for 'int', navigate with N or SHIFT-N
    /"a.*z"     Regular expressions!
    egrep -i    Ignores cases
