## Taught by: Stefan Idziak
### University of Waterloo, Fall 2016


## Lecture 1

No pre-requisites = no physics knowledge past high school grade 10 needed.

Mechanics

Inertia
"A body at rest tends to stay at rest."
Position: Where you are (two numbers describe this, basically a vector)
Velocity:
  1) How fast you are going (speed), and
  2) Which way you are going.
An object's mass determines how much inertia it has.
**Demo:** Small plastic ball resting on a card on top of a tube. Card flicked away,
ball drops into tube!

Acceleration: How fast your velocity is changing. (Change in speed, or
direction)
Note: Going in a circle is acceleration, because your direction is
changing.

Newton's Laws
First (inertia): An object not subject to outside forces moves at a constant
velocity, covering equal distances in equal times.
Second (f=ma): The force exerted on an object is equal to the product of the
object's mass times its acceleration. The acceleration is in the same direction
as the force.
"Light objects are easier to move than heavier ones."
Third (equal and opposite): Any force acting on an object has an equal and
opposite force acting from the object.
Note: This implies a normal force acts on objects sitting on the ground, held
by gravity.

Weight is the force applied by gravity. Mass is constant.
Massive objects have larger gravitational fields. e.g. Moon pulling on Earth's
tides, but human bodies don't affect much.

**Demo:** centre of mass--Triangular "hill" with a double-napped cone that appears
to roll up the hill. BUT its centre of mass is actually dropping between the
grooves as the triangle widens.

**Demo:** Gravity accelerates two different-weighted balls at the same rate.
Paper appears to fall more slowly, but that's just wind resistance.

**Demo:** Vacuum tube next to air-filled tube. Feather and coin in each. Vacuum
tube has both objects fall at the same rate.

**Demo:** Gravity is constant. Tossing a ball up in the air -> gravity acts on it,
accelerating it (downwards) constantly, even at the top of the arc.

**Demo:** Falling ball: horizontal velocity + gravity = parabolic arc.

**Demo:** Gun shooting at a monkey that drops from a tree when the ball is fired.
Aiming straight at the monkey, it still hits the monkey, because gravity acts
the same on the monkey and the bullet (or, more slowly, a dart).
"Monkey and hunter demo."

**Demo:** Two balls being dropped, one with some horizontal motion. Both hit the
ground at the same time.

Energy
(Gravitational) potential energy: a ball at rest up high, can be converted to
kinetic energy. More mass or more height means more gravitational potential
energy.
Different types of potential energy--springs, elastic, bouncy superball, etc.
Different types of plastic have different amounts of elasticity. Kinetic energy
becomes heat instead of elastic stored energy. A completely elastic rubber would
bounce back perfectly to the same height (stored elastic energy gets converted
back to kinetic in the opposite direction).
Inelastic collision => energy lost, crumpling/sound/heat resulted.
Sound is a very little amount of waste energy.
Burger = 500 calories = 2 million joules = 10000 hours of speaking.

Q: Is the amount of energy in the universe the same as when it was created?
A: Yes, probably, though we have to account for different energy conversion,
like mass-energy conversion.

Work means a change in energy. e.g. lifting a ball changes its potential
energy.
work = force*distance = mgh
Walking around with a ball = no work (ignoring the horizontal acceleration).
"If you live in residence, then if you wind up in the same bed as you started
in, you've done no work!"

Momentum
Tendency to continue moving in the same direction.
More massive objects have more momentum, as do faster objects.
momentum=mass*velocity
e.g. Bus doesn't get slowed down much when hitting a parked car.


## Lecture 2 - Sept 14 2016
Correction: Can't say energy levels in the universe are the same since when it
was created. At a universe scale, general relativity must be used, and that
means energy isn't very well defined.

**Demo:** Newton's cradle - metal balls, relatively elastic collisions.

Pushing a block of wood with your finger: must account for all forces acting on
the block. It's not accelerating, despite the constant force from your finger.
There is gravity and friction.

Friction
- Static (not moving): larger due to molecular "grooves" locking the object in
  place.
- Kinetic (moving)

Note: Wheel rolling at a constant speed doesn't have friction. Wheel and ground
aren't moving with respect to each other.

Friction does work (heat) - potential energy stays the same, but it removes
kinetic energy by generating heat.

Friction affected by:
- Downward force
- Type of material

**Demo:** 600-page phonebooks are hard to pull apart.

"Newtonian fluids act the way that you want."
"Paint is a fluid that shear thins. It stays on the brush from the pale because
it's at rest. When painting, its viscocity decreases and flows more, and it
comes off the brush."
"Not just two surfaces."

Linear motion has:
- Inertia (mass)
- Force
- Position
- Velocity
- Acceleration

Circular/Rotational Motion
Walking in a circle, you are accelerating, because your direction is changing.
(Static) Friction with the ground pushes you around (walking).

Centripital Force
F=m(v^2)/R
Bigger radius, smaller force
Bigger velocity, larger force
**Demo:** Swinging a ball tied to a string through a cylinder to a weight.
*Centrifugal* force is a force pushing outwards, not inwards (e.g. a
centrifuge)
Q: What makes you slide out of your car when you make a sudden turn while your
door is open and your bench seat is lubed up?
A: Inertia. The car disappears from underneath you.

**Demo:** Leverage on a tight bolt with a wrench by hand vs with a rod handle.
Note: Tools aren't designed for this, don't break your tools!

Torque: depends on force pushing down and how far away from the rotational axis
you are.

It also depends on "rotational mass" - moment of inertia, or how the mass is
distributed around the rotational axis.

Rotation also has a direction: one way or another along the rotational axis,
depending on direction of spin.

Angular momentum: things that spin tend to keep spinning.
**Demo:** Brittany spinning on a chair; putting legs and arms out slows you down
because angular momentum must be conserved. You can see this with figure
skaters. They start spinning with their legs and arms out then tuck their arms
in.

**Demo:** Spinning bucket of water.
"There is no centrifugal force, the force keeping you inside the car is going
inwards, against your inertia. It's centripital force."
If the gravitational force is greater than that required for circular motion,
the water will fall out.

**Demo:** Dishes
Table cloth leaves. Friction of table cloths pulls cup slowly. Friction force
slows it down to a rest and stops it.


## Lecture 3
re: Questions about bucket swinging in a circle.
On those amusement park rides that spin you around standing upright, at the
very top, you are falling. But the acceleration of gravity is less than the
force required to be spun around in a circle, so you don't break contact with
the wall.

**Demo:** Two people holding a rope.
One "pulse" goes down the rope slowly if there's slack and quickly if it's held
tightly. The frequency depends on the restoring force of the rope.
A double/triple wave thing is what we call "standing waves".

**Demo:** Spring rope with cowbell.
"Waves are a way to do work without moving."

Two types of waves:
1. Transverse oscillation.
 - Up and down, with a sideways direction. The crests move sideways, and each
   part of the rope swings up and down.
 - It has an amplitude, a wavelength (lambda) (peak-to-peak distance).

,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.

**Demo:** Breaking a wine glass.

**Demo:** "My physics guitar."
 - You can change the pitch my changing the tension of the strings.

2. Longitudinal oscillation

**Demo:** Slinky scrunched up at one end and released. A disturbance travels
length-wise.

Sound is a good example of a longitudinal wave.
Air molecules squeeze together then move apart.
A little bit of air moving back and forth near my mouth isn't the air reaching
your ears. The pressure waves do the work.

Like how you can't smell a person talking far from you.

Note: Liquid can also be compressed, like how you can hear people screaming
underwater. So can solids. e.g. Putting your head on the train tracks.

**Demo:** Line of 40 people getting pushed on stage.
Arms wave = transverse; pushed = longitudinal.

Speed (V) of wave:
Frequency of oscillations that happen per second.
Period of the wave (T) the time it takes for one oscillation to occur.
Speed of travelling wave: Velocity=Frequency*Wavelength

Doppler Effect
Change in train whistle.

(<- train) ,,..--''``''--..,,,,..--''``''-   \o/
     (train) ,.-'`'-.,,.-'`'-.,.-'`'-.,.-'    |
               (train ->).-`-.-`.-`-.-`-.-   / \

As the train comes towards you, the sound gets compressed, as the location of
the train changes by the time the sound reaches you.

**Demo:** Swinging a sound box over my head.

**Demo:** Weights on strings as pendulums.
 - The period depends on the length of the string and the acceleration of
   gravity. Different weights on the same string oscillate at the same
   frequency.
 - Standing (a barbie) next to a pendulum? "Don't be worried."

A pendulum is an "energy transfer device". Energy is conserved, so it won't
come back and hit someone standing next to it.

**Demo:** Push weight harder. Larger amplitude, but the period is the same!

Note: This is what's called "harmonic motion".

Picture: A pendulum clock, A.K.A an "escapement".
A pendulum with arms that slide into teeth on a gear. Every oscillation rotates
the wheel 1/30th of a revolution. With a period of two seconds, this can form
the second hand of a clock.

Harmonic oscillator
Mass on a spring (car on a track between springs.
Period stays the same regardless of the amplitude.

Resonance
Oscillators have a natural frequency at which they prefer to oscillate.
This is the resonant frequency of the oscillator.
If energy is applied at the same frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations
will increase.
e.g. Pushing a child on a swing. Push when they are moving away from you to
incease their speed.
e.g. Holding a slinkie and adding some force to it periodically.
e.g. Car driving on a bumpy road starts vibrating, and stops when you adjust
your speed.

e.g. Tacoma Narrows bridge.

Q: How do they build bridges now to avoid this?
A: Try to redistribute the masses, adjust stiffness, etc. But it still happens,
   e.g. the Thames (sp?)

**Demo:** String on vibration machine.
At a certain frequency, a "node" appears in the middle (plus one on either
side). Putting my finger in the middle doesn't interfere with the node.
Between the nodes are antinodes, where the string i sexcited.
At another frequency, there are only two nodes, at either end. This is the
first harmonic.


## Lecture 4
Recall: Speed of sound wave depends on density of material, metal, etc.
The restoring force of the material (resistance to squeezing/stretching) also
affect speed.

Wavelength is a string is limited by the length of the string and which
harmonic you're in.

**Demo:** Rubbing a wine glass to make a noise. Dip finger in water and drag it
around. Sound depends on material of wine glass. Crystal works best. Notice how
a styrofoam cup also makes noise, and the movement of my finger is more
noticeable. It oscillates the rim, oblong-wise, in two directions. Styrofoam is
soft so it can't hold energy, so the sound doesn't resonate. Glass is hard and
can hold onto energy between oscillations. Ringing requires continuous
oscillations.

"Benjamin Franklin had a glass harmonica."
"Mesmer also used one to 'mesmerize' people."

**Demo:** Wood pipe with closed ends. Pressure is fixed at either end.
We can still make a standing wave inside of it, by putting one end on a fire.
Air moves across one end of a pipe (like blowing on a bottle).  The wavelength
is long (low sound) because the pipe is long)

**Demo:** Wooden organ pipe. Whistle gap in the middle, and a removable stopper at
one end. The "boundary condition" is at the end, so we can change the frequency
by removing the stopper.

Similar: Sliding whistle, dog whistle.

**Demo:** Sliding tube with a loudspeaker at one end. Sliding it hits a couple of
maximums - that's the wavelength of the speaker!

**Demo:** Fire tube - you can see standing waves in the high points of the flames.

**Demo:** Clarinet straw - cut a slit in one end and it's like a clarinet. I can
"tune" it by changing the length of the straw, by cutting it!
"PBBBBBBBBBBbbbbbFffffffOOOOooooooEEeeeeeeeee" *applause*

**Demo:** Swinging a plastic tube with ridges - air rushing by the end of the tube
pulls air through, and the air vibrates as it rolls over the ridges.

**Demo:** "To show you how a wine glass vibrates."
Rubbing the handles of a metal bowl with some water in it creates a standing
wave in the water. The bowl's shape oscillates, pushing the water. You can't
see the bowl moving, but you can see the water.

**Demo:** Aluminium Rod
Transverse oscillation (bending the rod lengthwise) vibrated it but made no
sound (or very low frequency sound).
Longitudinal oscillation happens when you tap the end of the rod on the ground,
like a staff. It makes a sound!
I can also make a longitudinal wave by rubbing the rod with rozen on my fingers
to make them sticky.

**Demo:** Beer bottle with liquid in it. It's actually not a standing wave in the
gap inside the bottle, at least in a tall, thin-neck beer bottle. It's more
like a mass-spring system, with a "disc" of air at the top where the bottle cap
goes. Adding liquid decreases the volume of air inside, increasing hte
restoring force, increasing the frequency of the oscillation.
This is known as "Helmholtz Resonance".

Loud Speakers
Electromagnet acts on a speaker cone with a coil, creating a logitudinal wave
going away from the speaker.
"You can make sound with speakers." :O

**Demo:** White noise on two desktop speakers.
They are loud when in phase. But if you aim them at each other and make one the
opposite phase, it catches the sound and mutes the noise.

**Demo:** Crank-powered record player from a cabinet.
The record needle wiggles back and forth in the grooves.
When the needle skips it's hopping between grooves.
Stereo records have side-to-side AND up-and-down movement.
The grove's take on the shape of a waveform, and drag the needle back and forth.

Note: When we broke a wine glass, it was oscillating the opening at a high
enough amplitude so that the material breaks, like when squeezing a styrofoam
cup.

Sample questions posted on LEARN soon.

 

## Lecture 5
Gases
"You can do things with solids, liquids, and gases."
**Demo:** puts a nut in a ballon and swings it around to make a noise
**Demo:** puts liquid nitrogen inside a beaker with a ballon attached; ballon
       expands

Dipping your hand quickly into liquid nitrogen--a layer of gas from quickly
boiling nitrogen insulates your hand.

**Demo:** Steam engine (with a whistle!)

Pressure: Force applied divided by surface area.
e.g. Pushing your hand on a wall.

Temperature: Kinetic energy of gas particles; "thermal motion". Higher kinetic
energy = faster motion = more force when colliding with things = greater
pressure

**Demo:** Pressure meter

"Popcorn explodes like little bombs when heated up."
"So can potatoes (that's why you prick them), or eggs."
"A dozen eggs in a microwave can blow the door off."
"Mason jars mostly full of jam sucks the lid down."
"Actually not sucking, but we'll get to that in a minute."

Density
Low density = less particles hitting the box = less pressure.
High density = more particles hitting the box = more pressure.

Ideal Gas Law
PV = nRT
Pressure*Volume=NumberOfMoles*GasConstant*Temperature

Atmosphere / Atmospheric Pressure
The mass of all the air in a m^2 column all the way up is 10 tonnes.
Chop the air column into m^3 boxes. Ignore the sides, and think of the vertical
force. On top of one box, we have gravity from all the air above. On the
bottom, we have pressure from the air below.

**Demo:** Weights with springs on the bottom stacked up (on a pole). Spring on
bottom of stack compresses the most, next one a little less, next one less,
etc.
"Pressure increases as you get closer to the earth.

Atmospheric pressure is ~100 000 pascals (Pa) (newtons per square meter).
**Demo:** Prof laying on the ground. "There is 10 tonnes on top of me. The wieght
of a bus."
"When standing, I also have gas on all sides pushing on me equally."
"I'm an incompressable bag of water in a skin envelope."

Example: Bed of nails. Nail points are sharp and can pierce skin on their own,
but when spaced apart the pressure is divided so it's safe."
"The mistress of pain can handle nails a few inches apart."

**Demo:** Rod of brass = square inch of atmospheric pressure.

**Demo:** Black rubber square with a handle on top.
Lying flat, sealed around the edges, you can't pull it up. You can't pull
against the atmospheric pressure pushing down on the square. Small amounts push
on the corners, so I can peel those up easily.

**Demo:** Gasket halves put together with air pumped out. It's not a "vacuum
pulling it together", it's the force of atmospheric pressure pushing from the
outside, with nothing pushing back from the inside. It's an imbalance.
Like how sucking on a paper bag removes air, and the atmospheric pressure
crumples it from the outside.

**Demo:** Model hovercraft.

In a drinking straw, pressure is roughly the same on top as it is on the
bottom. Applying suction at the top removes a bit of air, lowering the
pressure, and then the atmospheric pressure acting on the liquid pushing down
pushes the liquid up the straw to balance it out.

Hydraulic pump: uses pressure.
A piston, like a syringe. The fluid inside is all the same pressure, but isn't
compressible.
Small force acting on the tiny opening to the piston lets you lift a heavy
object at the wide end of the piston, due to the same force acting on a larger
area.
This makes sense, since Work=Force*Distance. A larger movement doing work over
a distance can lift heavier things a small distance, e.g. a tire jack that you
crank by hand.

Bleeding your breaks: your breaks are hydraulic, your foot presses on a
small-diameter piston, which acts on a larger disk.
Air on your break lines reduces the movement--you compress air until you reach
the end of the range of the pedal.

**Demo:** Stepping on a balloon pops it. But four underneath a board spreads out
the force, and I can stand on it.


## Lecture 6
Bouyancy
Archimedes' principle: An object partially or wholly immersed in a fluid is
acted upon by an upward bouyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it
displaces.

**Demo:** Hollow boat in a bowl. It is low-density and weighs less than the bouyant
force of the water acting on it, so it floats (until I put water in it and make
it denser, and it sinks).

**Demo:** Fluid thermometer thing that looks like a bong. Heating it up causes some
of the glass bubbles of liquid gathered at the top to sink. Each one is
calibrated to sink at a certain temperature; they move as the density of the
water changes.

**Demo:** Hot air balloon. Heating the air below the balloon lowers the density of
the air in the balloon, so it rises. As the density of the balloon matched that
of the air, it hovered in place. After rising away from the torch, it hovers
again, then sinks.

Regular Balloons
A force is needed to stretch the rubber. The force comes from the inner
pressure being higher than the surrounding air. The density of the air inside
of the balloon is also greater.

Helium Balloon
Density of balloon+helium is < density of air, so it rises.

**Demo:** Cartesian diver
Squid/Octopus with a bubble inside of a water bottle sinks when the water
bottle is squeezed.
The density of the water doesn't change, because it's too hard to compress--but
the air bubble on the squid gets smaller.

You can pour liquids, solids (like sand), and gases!
**Demo:** Pouring dry ice into a cup with a candle into it quenches the candle.

**Demo:** Bubbles!
Air in a bubble is slightly denser than outside because it takes a bit of force
to expand the envelope. The bubble of soap-water-soap "biolayer" is very light,
so bubbles tend to float.

**Demo:** "Chopping" parsley by putting it in liquid nitrogen."
**Demo:** "Hammering a nail with a liquid-nitrogen-frozen banana."
Note: Liquid nitrogen is boiling because the banana is warmer than the
nitrogen and makes it evaporate.

"Ice cream is just a network of fat crystals encapsulating (flavored) water."

## Lecture 7
Electric charge
Opposite charges attract, like charges repel
The closer in proximity the charges are, the stronger the force

Coulomb's Law F=(k*q1*q1)/R^2
Force is proportional to the product of the charges divided by the distance
between them squared.

**Demo:** Rubbing a rod on little octopus things.

Silk tends to attract more electrons than glass does. So electrons jump from
the rod to the silk, and the rod gets a positive charge.

**Demo:** Electrometer moves when the positively-charged rod is *near* the device.
When the device is on its own, its charges are spread evenly so that it's net
neutral. When the rod is near, charges redistribute (electrons move towards the
positive rod). This creates an induced charge.

Touching the middle of the Electrometer while the induced charge is active
neutralizes that part of the device (electrons go towards the positive charge
near the bottom). A net negative charge remains when the rod is removed.

**Demo:** Wimshurst Machine (static generator). Wheel spun by hand with two balls
in the middle that arc. Pulling the charges apart is doing work, which stores
energy (increased voltage difference). Capacitors store charge, so we get
rather violent sparks.

**Demo:** Student "with long hair that doesn't use conditioner" touching
vaandegraaf generator. Conditioner makes your hair conduct slightly, so charge
distributes and it doesn't stand up.

**Demo:** Barbie on a Vaan de Graaf generator.

**Demo:** Metal ball between two parallel plates ticking back and forth when
Wimshurst Machine is charging. 

You can generate voltage in your body by rubbing your feet on the ground,
lifting up your feet, repeated. It's a small amount of current.

Dust filters: catch dust by passing air through small pores.
But that can get clogged, like how window screens can get clogged with bugs.

Electronic air cleaners pass negatively-charged dust through positively-charged
walls.

Corona Discharge
Something sharp that is charged leaks off of the point rather easily. Holding a
pin while walking on a carpet discharges you.

We can charge dust by pumping negative charge into a pin/wire, which cluster in
the tip. When the charge is big enough, electrons jump off the pin on their
own. As potential energy is released, light is emitted.

This creates what is called an "electric field".
**Demo:** Pin on Vaan de graaf generator reduces the spark discharge. Prof feels
his hair stand up from the electric field.
**Demo:** But bent rod on top of pin, and it spins! This is an electrostatic motor.
Charge flies out either end of the rod.

## Lecture 8
Recall: Electric force depends on charge and distance between them.
Look: Corona discharge wire from Xerox machine "thinner than a hair".
"This is my favourite demo. The Kelvin liquid drop generator. We drip water
into two pans, each one connected to either side of lightbulbs. The water falls
through metal rings connected to each pan. The stream breaks up into drops
randomly as it falls. The drop falling does work against the induced charge in
the ring. If a positive drop falls in one pan, its ring becomes negatively
charged, which draws down more positive charges through the stream of water,
causing more negative charge to flow into the other bucket."

Lightning Rod
Clouds shifting by each other builds up a charge in the cloud.
Lightning rods are connected to the ground, and its needle point discharges the
ground, making it a less attractive target for lightning.

Recall: Electrostatic Precipitator
"It's very hard to clog; all you have to do to clean it is to hit it with a big
hammer."

**Demo:** Metal cylinder with an electric charge traps the smoke from incense.
"This is our electronic air cleaners."
"This can also make industrial smokestacks appear to burn cleanly."
Aside: Emissions dipped in the states a couple decades ago because a cone was
invented that deflected smoke from the standardized sensor hung above it, until
congress amended that law."

**Demo:** Big phalic vandegraaf generator. "It could kill you if you touch the top."
 - We see corona discharge coming from the three arms at the top.
 - We can also light a nearby fluorescent tube.

Photoconductors
"Become conductors when light hits it."
In the dark, the photoconductor is neutral. A precharger gives it a negative
charge (a large power supply connected to a small corona discharge wire) onto
the outer surface of the belt. The outer side of the belt becomes negative, and
the inner side is grounded, and so it becomes positive. Then flashlamps light
up the page, and light bounces off mirrors and into the belt. There is no light
from the black spots of the paper. Light hitting the photoconducting outer
layer causes it to conduct and neutralize, so negative charge remains on the
blank spots. Positively-charged toner then sticks to the negatively-charged
image. The paper is negatively-charged, then passed over the belt. Then the
paper passes over the fuser (a heater) which melts the toner and sticks it to
the paper.

Note: Image is sharp because lenses focus the paper onto the drum.
Note: Charges could be reversed, some could be neutral, etc.
Note: Different shades of grey can be made where less light hits, so less
charge transfers.
Note: Different colours means different passes of illumination.

Laser Printers
Photoconducting drum with a precharger, being hit by laser beams, writing a
detailed image in the charge.
Old laser writer: Little spinning hexagonal mirror sweeps laser across top of
drum.

## Lecture 9

Midterm is on two Mondays from now.
Practice midterm is posted; you will get feedback on wrong answers.

Atoms and Electrons
 - Electrons orbit the nucleus
 - Some electrons break free of the nucleus and move freely through the metal
   (conductions). If they can't break free (easily), the material is an
   insulator.
 - Defects present in conductors obstruct conduction (electrons hit them and
   bounce off).
 - Temperature also affects conduction.

Electric circuits
 - Current flows from positive to negative.
 - Battery creates a voltage difference from its ends, via a chemical reaction.
 - Current flows through wire ("positive" charges flowing) (negative charges
   flow the other way)
    - So we always assume current flow is from + to -, even though we know
      electrons are moving another way.
 - Light bulb is load
 - Note: Don't think of charges zipping around the circuit when I connect the
   light bulb. When the circuit is connected, all of the free charges start
   inching forward slowly, all at once (defects slow them down).
 - Incandecent lightbulbs rely on heat generation to create light, which is
   inefficient.
 - Ohm's law: V=IR "voltage equals current times resistance"
 - Thin wires (and long wires) have more resistence than thick wires (or short
   wires).
 - With constant voltage, small resistence = big current; big resistence =
   small current.
 - Summing the voltage changes around the circuit must equal voltage of battery.

**Demo:** Cooling resistor makes lightbulb brighter.
**Demo:** Cooling semiconductor makes lightbulb dimmer.

 - Wiring batteries in parallel increases the current (brighter light).
 - Two lightbulbs in circuit draws more current.
   - Lights in parallel burn equally brightly (same voltage), but the tradeoff
     is that more current is drawn out of the battery.
 - Christmas lights go out if one bulb is faulty because they are wired in
   series.

Example current: Hair dryer at home
120W current
100W hair dryer
If resistance of wire = 1 Ohm and 10A of current are flowing,
V = IR = 10*1 = 10A of current available to hair dryer + lightbulb.
1200W hair dryer could be 120V @ 10A.

**Demo:** Conducting pickle conducts. "Usually the flower side of the pickle lights
up."

Direct current vs. Alternating current.
Direct: Constant voltage difference, constant direction.
Alternating: Current changes direction, voltage difference varies (sin wave).


Magnets

**Demo:** Grid of needles rotate and form the shape of the magnetic field.

COW MAGNETS (small cylindrical magnet with rounded edges, to catch metal cows
may accidentally graze on.

The north poll on a map is actually magnetic south.

Bar magnets have fixed magnetism.
Magnets in different (conducting?) material don't hold their magnetic
domain--can only be electromagnets.
https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=electromagnets%20vs%20bar%20magnets

Q: How do magnetic strips on credit cards work? (And how do they get
demagnetized?)
A: Strips have lines of magnetic domains, like magnetic barcodes. Putting a
magnet near it destroys the lines.

**Demo:** Loose coil of wire connected to current.
 - Wire clusters together (in two groups).
 - "The volume of the field is larger here."

**Demo:** Metal wire "trapeze" with current running through it, swings back and
forth past piece of metal.
Takeaway: Current moves perpendicular in relation to wire.

**Demo:** Circle attached to volt-ammeter; magnet moved around in the magnet
creates current. Moving back and forth creates an alternating current (needle
moves back and forth).

Lenz's law explains how this all works.
Current opposes change in magnetic field.
Circle turns into a magnet with a north pole pointing up, to resist the north
end of the magnet coming down.

**Demo:** Metal ring flies off of electromagnetic coil rod. Ring with a cut in it
doesn't move (no current flows).
**Demo:** Chilled ring flies farther.


## Lecture 10
Chris Hadfield!!!!!111one
## Lecture on rockets!
Will be on the midterm.
"He won't be sticking around after for selfies."

Rocket fundamentals
 - Higher pressure inside rocket thatn outside rocket
 - Momentum of mass exiting the rocket pushes rocket the other way
 - Common misconception: Rockets push against the air. That's not how they get
   thrust. They work in space. They work by pushing mass (e.g. water in
   fireman's hose) the other direction.
 - Standing on skates, if you throw a block of ice, you will move backwards.
 - Rockets were first used for fireworks--getting small amounts of explosive
   into the air.
 - A Canadian (Bill Leich?), at Queen's university, had the idea to launch
   more. (~1870s)
   - Also a Russian (Silkovsky) invented the rocket equation.

How do you generate power?
**Demo:** Water rocket is launched but quickly runs out of thrust, and drops.
In order to fire a rocket, we need to have some sort of powerful reaction going
on.
Like balancing a broom, rocket nozzles do little twitchy movements making
adjustments, changing the vector of thrust and pointing it in the direction it
needs to go.
Silkovsky, before any of this, realized that fuel is difficult to carry all the
way up.
So the Space Shuttle was a two-stage rocket: Two white initial thrusters that
push above the air.
"Staging makes it so that you don't have to haul all of the dead weight with
you up into space."
This kerosene torch burns oxygen from the surrounding air--atmoshperic
oxygen--but bigger rockets that go above the air need their own oxygen supply.
We can control this kerosene "rocket" by letting more fuel in.
*plays with kerosene torch*
But with solid rocket fuel, with built-in oxygen supply, you can't turn it off.
It's powerful, but a "brute force" approach.

Q: How do you come back down, if you burn all the fuel on the way up?
A: You have a tiny rocket onboard to knock us out of orbit, turning our
circular orbit into an ellipse. When we touch the atmosphere, it's like
sticking your hand out the window on the highway, and air friction slows us
down with drag.

Q: How efficient are these big rockets? How much energy do they lose to
heat/sound/etc.
A: The main goals are to use as little fuel as possible, and to have as light a
rocket as possible.

e.g. The big orange tank on the shuttle used to get painted white so that it
would look better, until someone counted the paint cans and realized we were
bringing 1000lbs of paint up with us, instead of 1000lbs of useful stuff. So
we stopped painting it.

"2/3 of people who have flew in space have flown on the space shuttle."
It had many tradeoffs, and was very complex, and we're still very new at rocket
flight. We are learning as we go. We did lose two shuttles (and crews).

Q: Do pilots steer?
A: Depends on if you are in a Soyuz or a Shuttle. In the shuttle, we had a
joystick that let us steer.  In the Soyuz, we would "Gimbal". The little
steering jets on a lander are made with reliable fuel--chemicals that explode
when they come together. No weak Canadian Tire lighters needed!

Q: What does it feel like to ride in a rocket?
A: Depends on the rocket--Branson's feels like a powerful car. You will feel ~4
times your body wait. In the shuttle, though, The solid rockets burned
inconsistently. You get sucked back in your seat, and vibrated like a tuning
fork. Your head is in a little polishing machine. You need to pull your head
forward and let your neck absorb the vibration in order to see the instruments.
"So it's a bit of a rough ride."

The most efficient fuel we came up with is hydrogen and oxygen. Franklin
Chen-Diaz flew on the Shuttle 7 times, is also a rocket maker. He's trying to
make a solid-state impulse rocket, that pushes matter out the end a bit faster.
This may be the engine that takes us to Mars.

Q: What training?
A: I flew F-18s in WW2. After that I went to flight school, and four different
Universities (including Waterloo!)

What do you need to fly a rocket?
You need to make snap decisions very quickly.
You need to be healthy--most are hired at age 36, and fly between 36-56.
You hire pilots, medical doctors, etc. Technical talent helps, and jobs of high
responsibility.
That's why we hire test pilots. The test pilots who make bad decisions are all
dead! *grim laugh*
When I flew the Russian Soyuz, I had to learn Russian. When I had to learn
Russian, I only new three words in Russian. Da, Niet, and Vodka!
Now time for a demo: I'm gonna fly a rocket in the hallway. Follow me!


## Lecture 11
(Before midterm.)
Electron orbits Neutron that can't be broken down.
Current: P=IV
Alternating vs Direct Current
Magnets and Electricity: Electric field can create a magnet, and vice-versa.

**Demo:** Stationary magnetic field near conductor (ring on table) doesn't do
anything, but a moving magnetic field creates current. Slow movement generates
less. Rotating magnet in place generates alternating current.

Lenz's Law "Explains what's going on here."
The current induced by a changing magnetic field always produces a magnetic
field that opposes the change.

**Demo:** Rods of different metal next to each other. Looks like a ladder on its
side. Rings on each rod can be dropped down and "raced" and some fall faster
than others. Copper is best. Aluminum is worse. Brass is even worse. Why?
Because Copper is the best conductor here.

**Demo:** "Guillotine" thing, looks like the base of a trebuchet made of metal,
with a sawblad that swings downthrough a gap in a magnet at the base.
 - Blade with gaps in it (like a fork) passes right through, because the
   magnetic field isn't big enough to bridge it.
 - Blad with small gaps stops eerily fast as soon as it hits the bottom of hte
   arc, where the magnet is.

**Demo:** Lethal 2000V capacitor discharged crumples a Monster Energy drink can
evenly.
"With enough voltage, you can cut the can, but this one looks strong."

Transformer
AC current makes it easy to change voltage.
Primary coil and secondary coil looped around transformer coil

        '----------------------'

Vin/Vout = #turns in primary coil / #turns in secondary
"If the secondary coil has more turns, the voltage will go up."

"Green boxes on peoples' lawns are also transformers."
We want 110V to come into our house.

Observe: A foot of coaxial cable, like the ones buried outside your house.
Coaxial cables have two different conducting materials, with one close to
ground, so that it deosn't short into a shovel if you accidentally dig into it.

Two wires come into your house: Live (AC), and neutral. You also have a ground
connected to your house. They run into the breaker box in your house.

American outlets have two prongs (Live and neutral) and a round prong (ground).

Since we have enormous amounts of power coming in, we need to protect our
smaller wires inside the house. Thus, fuses.
Fuse wire heats up (I^2 * R) eventually melts and breaks the circuit--protects
the light bulb.

Alternatively, we have circuit breakers - "resetable fuses".
Bimetalic strip--two differently conducting pieces of metal stuck together.
They each have different expansion rates. So as they heat up, one expands
faster, and the strip curls. This breaks the current, at least until it cools
back down. So circuit breakers trip a spring-loaded mechanical switch to keep
the circuit open once the strip bends once. So if something bad is happening,
the current stays off until you reset the switch.

**Demo:** Circuit breaker with exposed innards. *plays with switch*

Q: Why don't you use circuit breakers everywhere?
A: Circuit breakers are expensive. Fuses cost pennies, circuit breakers cost
   $20. Also, sometimes you want permanent fuses for safety (e.g. a microwave
   malfunctioning will melt its fuse and die permanently, to protect the
   owner).

Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)
Current coming back should match current going out.
Remember: Two wires, say these black and white ones, live and neutral.
Alternating current flowing through these wires causes two different magnetic
fields that cancel each other out hwen all is well. If they differ slightly, a
solenoid inside the coiled wires fires and opens a switch.

**Demo:** "Household wiring example" (plank of wood with sockets, switch, GFCI
switch, fuse, circuit breaker, power metre, lightbulb)
Lightbulb is demoed with all three breaking devices. All is well.
Now let's plug in a radio instead of a lightbulb.
*grabs barbie and "bath" (bowl of water)*

Through a circuit breaker, the radio falls in the bathtub and it stays on! The
breaker doesn't trip, because the wire doesn't melt. It's not overvolted. 0.3A
continues through the <0.5A breaker

Same with the fuse.

With the GFCI, we hear a switch fire immediately, and the metre turns off, as
does the GFCI switch light. House won't burn down, because the circuit breaker
still protects the house, but there is no circuit coming through the
radio/outlet. Barbie is safe!

"Usually happens within the first cycle of the current!"

When you press the "test" button, you connect a small resistor, and it trips
the solenoid.

"Everything up till now is on the midterm."

Today's Lesson: How Radios Work

Electric field lines move from positive to negative charges.
A charged particle experiences a force along the field lines.
Electric charge creates an electric field (monopole).
Magnet creates a magnetic field (dipole).
Changing electric field produces a magnetic field.
Changing magnetic field produces a electric field.

Antenna
Charge moves up and down the antenna, producing a polarized electric field
(electric field only moves up and down--vertically polarized).
A vertically polarized electric field creates a horizontally polarized magnetic
field.
"An accelerating charge creates a wave--the strength of the electric field at
 each point in time."
"Light, radio waves, IR waves, are all electromagnetic waves. The difference
 between them is the wavelength."

Q: Why do light and other waves propogate in space?
A: Imagine a changing electric field generates a magnetic field, which
generates an electric field... but we don't really know.

"The magnetic field and electric field are always perpendicular to each other."

Tank Circuit
Inductor: Coil that creates a magnetic field (stores energy).
Capacitor: Stores electric charge (energy).

Adorable demo: 9V battery charging a little capacitor. Discharging the little
capacitor by bending its little arms together creates a little spark!
"My skin isn't a very good conductor. Blood inside the body, or wet fingers,
would probably ruin this."

Tank circuit is a "resonant electric circuit". Lenz's law is important here. It
creates self inductance.

Capacitor charged, no field -> capacitor discharging, current flowing, field
growing -> capacitor discharged, maximum field, field reducing, capacitor
charging -> field minimum, capacitor charged

"This is a simple harmonic oscillator, just like a mass on the spring."
"Changing the size of the charge in the capacitor changes the frequency."

"There is also an induced Lenz's law current in the other direction, resisting
 the movement of the charge, this is called self induction."

Oscilloscope shows decreasing magnitude of oscillation.
We have an alternating capacitor in our tank circuit--essentially two metal
plates rotating over each other. More overlap means a bigger charge. This is
what happens when you turn the knob on your radio to tune it.

Radio transmitter-receiver
Transmitter: Electric charge oscillates, draining tank circuit.
*electric field is formed*
Receiver: Electric charge oscillates, feeding tank circuit (assuming it's tuned
to the signal).
Works only if frequencies of tank circuits match.

Demo (broken): Theramin
Capacitance of signal changes based on obstructions between antenna.

Tuning your radio means changing the natural/resonant frequency of your tank
circuit. It only amplifies the same frequency signal coming in.

Note: Optimal length of an antenna is a quarter of the wavelength.

**Demo:** Radio transmitter and receiver cone things pointed at each other.
 - Strong signal when pointed at each other
 - Weak field when farther away
 - Rotated transmitter drops signal in receiver to zero
   - Radio waves are polarized, so antennas need to be pointed in the same
     direction
 - Metal grate blocks polarized waves
 - Two combined to make a grid blocks all signal
   - "Remember this for when we talk about microwave safety next week."

Original long-distance radios were microwave; they needed line-of-sight.

Q: How are sounds encoded in this signal?
A: Compressions and rarefactions of the air in sound can be represented in a
   waveform. Radios receive varying signal and amplitude, which can be
   translated to an audio waveform.

AM: Amplitude modulation
FM: Frequency modulation

Driving under powerlines interferes with your radio, because the strength of
the magnetic fields in the lines overwhelms the tank circuits.

Radar jammers send powerfull disrruptive signals like this.


## Lecture 13
Halloween! Spooky! The helper dog at the front of the class is wearing a devil
costume!

**Demo:** Theramin
**Demo:** Drip generator

Past question: Why does one end of a pickle light up?
A: Don't know. It's biology.

Past question: Is density of material related to resistance?
A: [Periodic table of elements coloured by density] Nope.

Past question: Why do EM waves travel at the speed of light?
A: A phonon is theoretical a particle with zero mass. Anything with zero mass
travels at the speed of light, according to relativity.

Past question: How does light travel through a vacuum?
A: It just does. This was a big question in physics for a long time. But EM
waves don't need any material to propogate.

Question: Can you generate gravitational waves?
A: Gravitational waves were just discovered. Talk to me after class!

**Demo:** Radio waves are polarized. Here's an AM radio station being played on an
old radio. If I rotate the radio 90 degrees, it gets quiet. When it's loud,
assuming the radio's receiver is lengthwise along th width of the radio, we
know the radio is perpendicular to the radio wave, and so the transmitter is
somewhere in fron or behind it.

Note: FM radios are circularly polarized, with two waves forming a cross. So
receivers can be oriented in any direction. AM can't do the same because the
antennae are so large.

Amplitude Modulation (AM) Radio
 - First type of radio used.
 - Easy to make.
 - Carrier frequency (550kHz-1600kHz)
 - Radio station varies power at which it transmits; varies the amplitude of
   the waves it's transmitting.
 - High-frequency AM wave is tightened at certain places, forming an antinode.
   Wavelets fill in the area under the desired curve.
 - Note: Silence is indistinguishable from noise. Quiet radio shows are hard to
   listen to from far away.

Frequency Modulation (FM) Radio
 - Always transmits at full power, so it's always loud, and quiet isn't noisy.
 - Slightly varies frequency to denote sound wave amplitude.
 - [photo: Sound wave / Carrier frequency / AM / FM comparison]
 - AM is fairly narrow bandwidth, and the spectrum is regulated.
 - FM is a higher frequency to start with, and has higher fidelity sound.

AM radio signals die off slowly as you drive out of town. FM drops off
suddenly.

Television Tube (Cathode Ray Tube, or CRT)
1. Cathode ray (electrons come out)
 - Cathode (hot wire)
 - grid (negative charge accelerates electrons)
 - anode (positive charges)
 - focusing coil focuses electrons on phosphor screen
2. Anode (accelerates them)
3. Focusing coil (filters?)
4. Deflecting coil (electromagnet, spreads them out)
5. Phospher coating (lights up when hit with electron)

Note: The electron beam traveling through the vacuum is a part of the circuit!
Electrons flow back around once they hit the metal plate at the front.

**Demo:** Little glass CRT ball thing.
Coils on either side of the ball make it look like a Droid Rolling Tank.
Voltage through electron gun paints a little green dot on the phospher.
Putting voltage through coils aims the dot down or up, depending on direction
of current.
Magnet waved around the ball can also move the dot.

Phospher Screen
 - Electron beam scanned across hte phosphor screen.
 - Grid voltage adjusts to send electrons or cut them off.
 - Image scanned 30 times a second (actually, half an image every 16th of a
   second - that's why they call it interlaced).

Colour Television
 - Different phosphor dots glow either red, green, or blue.
 - Three electron guns, each one focusing on a shadow mask and illuminating
   only one of red, green, or blue pixels on phosphor screen.
 - Shadow mask: Looks like a screen. Geometrically, three electron guns in a
   line can only project onto certain phosphors.
 - Putting a magnet near a black and white is okay--it temporarily shifts the
   electron beam. But with a colour tv, you risk magnetizing the shadow mask,
   and permanently damaging the display. This is why some old CRT monitors have
   a "degauss" button. It applies a massive electric current for a short time
   to demagnetize the shadow mask.

**Demo:** Breaking open an old CRT with a hammer
 - Glass is a half centimeter thick
 - Little "getter" inside the tube collects stray gas particles


## Lecture 14
Waves and Velocity
Wave has wavelength LAMBDA and frequency f.
Time to travel one wavelength in distance is 1/f(?)
Electromagnetic Spectrum
Radio > microwave > infrared > visible > ultraviolet > xray > gamma ray
Radio has the largest wavelength, and the least amount of energy, and thus the
least potential to do damage.

Microwaves and water
2.45GHz frequency EM waves, 12cm wavelength
Water is a polar molecule; electric field oscillates and reverses direction
causing the water to flip back and forth, generating heat.
Microwaves can only be used to heat polar liquids (water). Can't heat oil, or
ice (molecules can't rotate)
"People working on radar transmitters occasionally start to feel warm."

"Vegetable oil has a lot of polar components, and can actually heat up faster
 than water!"

How to make microwaves
Very small inductor and very small capacitor
C-shaped conductor--small gap is a capacitor; rapidly alternating conductor
generates little waves.

Magnetron 1
8 tank circuits all working together
Need to extract power (to cook food)
Need to replace that power
Add a filament at ~4000V through the middle to produce electrons, these will
flow to the positive terminals.
This will remove charge from tank circuit and interfere with mixrowave
production.
Two magnets, one above the magnetron and one below, causes charges coming off
the wire accelerating towards the positive terminals, to bend.

Magnetron 2
Adding a magnetic field causes the electrons to bend their path and hit the
negative terminals, charging the system more.
Attach antenna (1/4 wave) to one of the terminals.

Can you put metal into a microwave?
You are told not to, but technically, microwaves are made of metal!
Thick metal has low resistance and doesn't heat up (but reflects like light).
"So, you can put metal into a microwave oven!"
Metal mesh prevents microwaves from exiting the microwaves.

When you are cooking, some parts don't get so hot. Why?
There are standing wave effects inside microwaves, too.

Mylar with thin coating of aluminum (thin = high resistance) "birthday balloon
material" sparks. So do CDs.

Putting a lightbulb in the microwave caused it to light up. It got brighter,
then dimmer, etc. Those are areas in the electric field that were strong then
weak in the microwave as the bulb rotated.
Glass is thin--microwaves went through it. Filament then had an induced charge
(thin wire in a strong electric field!)

Make sure you always have a cup of water in the microwave to absord energy.
Also don't do it for too long, and prepare for a possible fire.


## Lecture 15
Guest lecture: SCI 207: Physics, the Universe, and Everything

Energy
 - lifeblood of the universe
 - the story of everything that was, is, and ever will be
 - what is it? No one knows, exactly. It is one of the great mysteries.
 - Einstein discovered two clues:
   1. all forms of energy have mass (E=mc^2)
   - a hot cup of coffee (thermal energy) has more mass than the same cup of
     coffee cold! The thermal energy we added has mass, as does all forms of
     energy. Conversely, all mass has energy.
   2. Relativity, gravitational wells bend light, etc.
 - Eternal. Never created or destroyed, always conserved. We will never run out.

Entropy
BUT, energy does run "down", to less useful forms of energy.
- If the universe were to reach an equilibrium (no gradients of temperature,
 pressure, density), energy could no longer flow/transform, "Lifeblood"
 freezes
- The quantity of energy is always constant, but the quality continually
 decreases. It starts off "ordered", like a falling ball, and dissepates.
- Disorder = entropy
- Things naturally become less orders
- Second law of thermodynamics
- So what?
- The flow to disorder is the force that animates living organisms, and
  possibly created life in the first place
- Living organisms do not consume energy. Energy in = energy out. We
  consume order (e.g. hamburger) and output body heat, etc. (less ordered)

Diffusion of particles (e.g. dye molecules dropped into some water).
 - an example of entropy increasing
 - happens spontaneously: there are many more ways for the particles to be
   spread out than to get closer together again, or localized
 - totally random, not governed by any laws, like the law of large numbers
 - that random diffusion is what creates life!

Diffusion of thermal energy is another example
 - spontaneously flows from hot to cold things

Summary: entropy/disorder of the universe spontaneously increases, on average
(on balance). That's the loophole! Order can decrease locally, like in living
organisms.
Living organisms spontaneously extract order from (the flow to) disorder.

Machines exist all around us that spontaneously extract order fom (the flow to)
disorder.

**Demo:** Cup of hot water with a spinning wheel on top.
Like a car's piston, it absorbs only right-moving kinetic energy, from purely
random kinetic energy.
Humans are smart. We can build order. We can attach pulleys to wheels like
this, and move cars, airplanes, build cities.
Early on, humans could create heat. That sparked everything--eventually the
industrial revolution, etc.

A human is the same sort of machine:
 - It takes in high quality/ordered energy (food)
 - It "burns" it and expels low quality/disordered energy (excrement & body
   heat)
 - In the process, we create order.
 - Once you have a machine, you just "feed it", and it will function
   spontaneously. The spontaneous flow from order to disorder animates life.
 - A human consumes order.
"This baby is the same as this piston."
"Like how topologists can't tell the difference between a donut and a coffee
mug."

Questions begged:
 - You're joking, right? How are living organism be essentially identical to a
   piston engine.
 - Even then, how could a machine as complex as a human spontaneously arise in
   the first place?
 - Nature spontaneously creates all kinds of ordered structures, like
   snowflakes. If I'm just a snowflake, what does that say about the purpose of
   life? Am I a "special snowflake?"

Human as a Piston Engine
 - ATP is the universal energy currency of all life on earth. Plants, animals,
   etc.
 - ADP (A-P-P) gets an extra phosphate tacked onto it and becomes ATP.
 - ATP provides high-quality energy.
 - Electrochemical battery
   - i.e. drop a cube of iron (Fe) into a copper (Cu) sulfate solution
   - electrons spontaneously flow from Fe to Cu2+ ions, in random directions
   - IDEA: force electrons to flow in one direction only, exactly like we
     extracted ordered KE in the piston engine! Then use electric current to
     "charge" ADP to ATP!
   - Nature uses a similar electrochemical battery reaction, with glucose and
     oxygen. Glucose gets "snipped" into two pyruvate ions (acts like Fe to
     donate electrons to Oxygen)
   - Oxygen has a strong affinity for electrons, acting like Cu2+

Problem: Complexity
The ADP->ATP machine is very complex!
The electron flow drives a "proton pump" that forces protons across a membrane,
creating a "proton gradient" that stores potential energy (like a battery) for
later use.
This store of energy is tapped by allowing protons to flow back across the
membrane through a machine called the ATP synthase (like a little tube that
opens up in the membrane).
An electric field in the proton gradient accelerates the protons to large KE.
They collide with angled vanes attached to a shaft, forcing it to rotate.
Like a rotary motor, the turning shaft mechanically converts ADP to ATP. It's
very much a physical gear.
This type of machinery is universal to all life, as universal as the genetic
code itself.
It exists inside mitochondria in cells.

This is very hard-won knowledge. Thousands of scientists working for a very
long time.
[video: The ATP synthase machine]
Is this an exmple of intelligent design? Yes!
Spontaneous emergence of order/complexity happens throughout the universe, ever
since the big bang has been expanding and contracting, causing various
structures, like galaxies, to "condense out".
At each stage, local entropy decreases, but net entropy increases.
Thermodynamics are obeyed.
Example: Snowflakes. Thermal energy flows out when they are created, creating
more disorder in the universe.

Big question: How did the complex machinery that builds protiens come from in
the first place?
This is where physics can come into play.

The second law is not strictly true. In microscopic systems, the entropy of an
isolated system can fluctuate, mostly increasing, but sometimes decreasing.

Jeremy England, MIT Biophysicist, applied this deeper understanding of the
second law to living organisms.

"Dissipation-driven adaptation of matter"
"You start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long
enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant."
"Structures emerge spontaneously that are better at eating energy (sunlight) in
their environment." (chlorophyll molecule with the proper size to absord light
rays' wavelength)
"Under the right circumstances, which aren't rare at all, matter tends
naturally toward greater organization, complex structures and adaptive
behaviour, making life a likely, even inevitable result of physics"
"may subsume evolution, or even explain the origin of life (pre-life adaptation
to environment)"

The question, "why is there life?" is still unanswered, and this is all still
speculative.

This is just one thread from (life, universe, everything) topics in sci207.

The roots of life go all the way back to the big bang itself.
The origin of free energy (the sun). Where did hte sun's energy come from? The
universe self-expands. It all ties back to the beginning of the universe.

We look at all these questions:
 who are we? (nature of life)
 where did we come from? (origin of life)
 are we alone? (extraterrestrial life)


## Lecture 16
Sparks
 - Electric field can be large near sharp points.
 - Get arcing (or sparks).
 - Very thin metal, such as the gold rim of a plate or glass has large
   resistance and will heat up and melt, damaging the plate.
 - If a spark occurs near something combustible, fire results.

**Demo:** Inside of a microwave.
 - Magnetron
 - Power supply (sometimes varies its output, sometimes magnetron varies pull).
 - Three switches: on/off, timer (?), and killswitch. Killswitch is tripped
   when door is open--short circuits and melts a fuse.

**Demo:** White light shone through a prism.

**Demo:** Record printing.
Copper plate is a heavy cast of an original recording. It is used to stamp
other stampers for mass production.
Hihg-quality master plates can be cut directly with diamond needles, that are
of the highest quality but can't be used in mass produciton due to degradation.

Refraction
**Demo:** Laser light bending through a block of plastic (?).
Concave vs. Convex mirrors / lenses.
**Demo:** Magnifying glass focusing image of classroom lights onto a sheet of paper.
Note: diagram describes a projector, not a magnifying glass, which is a
"virtual image". Take another physics class to learn about that.
Lenses have a single focal length, and two (?) focal points, one on either side
of the lense.

The Eye
A double-convex lens "double outie". Converges light.
Light from far away gets focus on the back of the retina (if you have good
vision and are focusing on the object).
If you are near-sighted, the focal point is nearer to the front of the eye.
This is corrected with a diverging lens.
If you are far-sighted, the image focuses behind the retina, which is corrected
by a converging lens.
Note: Power of lens is 1/(focal length). Number on prescription is the power on
your lens.

In order to see your full body in a mirror, it has to be half of your height.
The size of your reflection doesn't change with distance to/from the mirror!

Flat mirror: incident angle (incoming) equals reflected angle.
Parabolic mirror: acts like a lens.

Polarizing Films
Naked light: Light in all sorts of polarizations are emitted.
One polarizing film: Cuts ~50% of the light, filters on direction of
polarization.
Two polarizing films: When rotated at 90 degrees, blocks all light, on
a gradient depending on rotation.

Liquid Crystals
Liquid phase: No orientation.
Nematic phase: Oriented similarly directionally but not positionally.
Smectic phase: Oriented directionally and on planes.

Place a very thin pirce of metal n either side of the liquid crystals. Thin
enough to see through, but thick enough to conduct. 
Early liquid crystal displays (i.e. in watches) faded slowly, were "too gooey"
to rotate quickly.

LED: Produce different coloured light sources vs. filtering white light with
polarizers.
OLED: No power when black.
Plasma: Little flourescent tubes.

Interference
Constructive vs. Destructive
**Demo:** "Zeussophone"--square piping structure with a loudspeaker on one side and
a cone on the opposite side. Structure is slid upwards like a trombone, and the
sound coming out gets louder, quiter, louder,... as waves stack or interfere on
the cone side.

**Demo:** Laser pointer thing that projects a grid-like set of dots on the wall.
This is constructive interference of unfoused beams of light.

Digital Representation of Sound
Digital curve under the analog sound curve. Higher sample rate = better fit to
curve.
CDs use 16 bits per sample.
Change of base example: bin(1011) == dec(8)

Compact discs have a spiral, like a record, with bumps and divets.
A polymer film is put on a disc of glass. It is then etched with light beams.
First a father, which creates multiple mothers, who make even more stampers.
The metal side of the CD is the label side!

CD Player Optics.
Laser
Diffraction grating (for focusing)
Beam splitter
 - Detector
 - Quarter wave plate (turns polarized light circularly one quarter, so after
   going through an back it is oriented to get caught by a polarized beam
   splitter)
   - CD surface

Wavelength of laser limit the amount of information you can store.

Older CD players have trouble reading writeable CDs.
Why? Old CD players have more primitive detectors; relied on intense changes of
constructive/destructive.
Writeable CDs have a dye that changes from reflective t less reflective, so we
need mroe sensitive detectors.
Blu-Ray discs have blue lasers. Smaller wavelength = more info.


## Lecture 17
Alternative Energy
Generator
  - Coil
  - Spinning magnet
  - Coil
  - Load, e.g. lightbulb (attached to each coil).

**Demo:** Fan being blown by a turbine.
 - Makes light blink while it turns (generates electricity)
 - Can attach power to a smaller fan to make it spin.
 "You can use wind to make wind!"
**Demo:** Beach crawler spider thing that crawls when blown on.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSKyHmjyrkA]

**Demo:** Put an alternating current across the coil instead of a load. It becomes
an engine!
 - Magnet will spin at the same frequency as the AC.

**Demo:** Spinning electromagnet engine.
 - Instead of changing the field of the outer magnets, we are changing the
   field of the internal magnets. The split-ring commutator conducts direct
   current in different directions as it spins.
 - Can also have permanent magnets on the outside and just have electromagnets
   and commutator spinning inside.
 - Varying DC input power increases the motor's speed.
 - Varying frequency of AC input on AC motor varies its speed.
 - Can be hard to get started if vertical "like a bicyclye whose pedals are
   straight up and down".
 - Torque varies depending on angle of magnets.
 - More magnets make for smoother motion.

**Demo:** 4-stroke gasoline combustion engine.
 - Cylinder
 - Piston
 - Crankshaft
 - Camshaft (attached to crankshaft by gear; drives valves, every other
   cylinder has a knob lined up, others are a half-spin around)
 - Intake (blue) valve, from carborator/fuel injector: gas+air mixture in
 - Exhaust (red) valve: exhaust gas out
 - Spark plug fires every time the piston rises (unconventional, but simple)
   - At the top, the gas is very compressed, and the magnet is about to
     discharge for a spark. High temperature => high pressure => pushes piston
     down.
 - Flywheel has magnets that generate a small electric current for hte spark
   plugs.
4 strokes:
 - induction (down)
 - compression (up)
 - power (down, forcefully)
   - Chemical energy becomes mechanical energy
   - Camshaft spins at half speed, lets the engine keep going despite each
     cylinder firing once every other full rotation.
 - exhaust (up)
2 stroke: exhaust and induciton occur simultaneous; spark fires every time the
cylinder is up.

Engines waste heat by design.
Typically lose 20-30% to heat.
Improvements for efficiency: longer power stroke (lower temp exhaust)
Advantage: Gasoline energy can be transferred very quickly at the pump.

Other inefficiencies in cars:
 - Braking
 - Air resistance

Q: How does braking affect the engine?
 - In a manual, the engine is connected directly to the wheels. We stall when
   the clutch connects before the wheels have enough momentum, and the motor's
   motion siezes.
 - Automatic transmissions have torque converters that do this automatically.
Q: ABS works by automatically detecting a skid (wheels not spinning) and
pulsates the brakes to prevent locking of wheels and steering.

Q: How do turbo chargers work?
A: They are fans connected to the crankshaft (?) that pressurizes the inducted
   gas+fuel mixture, so that it explodes with more pressure. This can cause
   "engine knock" if the gas mixture is pressurized too much and ignites on its
   own. So use a higher octane fuel (higher ignition temp).

Q: What's the difference in diesel engines?
A: No spark plugs. Air is pumped in that pressurizes the diesel enough to
   self-ignite it.

Hybrids
 - Gas engine and electric engine.
 - Battry
 - Generators
   - To pull off of idle engine, if battery can be charged. If battery is full,
     engine turns off instead of idling.
   - To apply to brakes to convert forward motion into electricity.  (there is
     also a real friction break, for emergencies / rapid breaking).
 - Better for city driving ("free" energy when stopping/starting, as you would
   have anyway), but less appealing for highway (constant speed).
 - Can get away with smaller gas engine in a hybrid.
 - F1 cars are hybrid (mainly breaking--ERS).

Aside: Supercars are also hybrid to compensate for engine lag during gear
changes, and to improve low-RPM torque.

Battery
Alkaline | Ion barrier | Manganese

Drawback of electric cars: takes a long time to charge through an outlet.

Hydrogen fuel cell
 - H acts like one side of the battery (with air on the other side).
 - Instead of recharging a battery chemically, we continually replace both
   sides.
 - Polymer electrolyte membrane in the middle, with catalysts on either side.
**Demo:** small hydrogen fuel cell
 - Two bubbles in the charger's tanks: one is twice as large (the hydrogen, as
   there are twice as many gas molecules).
 - Hydrogen fuel cells are rare in practice, because they are "finicky". Water
   membrane must be saturated just right, temperature and pressures must be
   just right, requires lots of electrical control.

Solar Energy
 - Heat -> Steam -> Generator
 e.g. Paralax (?) mirror reflects light onto a pipe of water.
 e.g. Parabolic mirror array directs light onto tower (with water inside).
  - Downside: birds
  - Downside: no storage of energy
**Demo:** Lamp shining on little solar panel conncected to a fan; spins faster as
lamp is closer to panel; needs a slight push because motor is stuck veritically
between magnets.


## Lecture 18
Project deadline is now 11am on Saturday.

**Demo:** Oscilloscope
Yellow flatline at the bottom at first indicates 0V.
Blowing on a connected fan steadilly raises the yellow line.
Stopping at a certain point, the line isn't flat, but bumpy. That's a "frozen
charge", probably due to the commutator being held halfway.

Quantum Mechanics

Electrons behave as particles and waves. So do photons.
Pauli exclusion principle: No two indistinguishable Fermi particles can ever
occupy the same quantum wave.
Old model of an atom: Electron particles orbiting the nucleaus.
Quantum model: Electrons as standing waves [picture: red nucleus surrounded by
circular gradient of standing waves]
"Different electrons can be thought of as different standing waves."

Electrons are sorted into different energy levels, depending on spin and
angular momentum (don't worry about that terminology).

When electrons change enregy levels, energy is lost (e- goes from high energy
level/state to a lower level), in the form on a photon. The frequency of the
emitted photons (light) depends on the level change, which varies between
substances (neons have different bright colours).

Band structure
 - Also have energy levels when there are lots of atoms (i.e. a solid).
 - Bands can be full, empty, half-full.
 - Band gaps between bands.
 - Bands fill from the bottom up, as electrons want to be in the lowere energy
   levels.
 - Valence band (highest energy) being full means the atom is stable.

Photoconductor
 - Varies conductivity based on exposure to light
 - Typically need a severe change in brightness; also tend to have a 2 min
   timer for clouds passing over.
 - As an insulator, valence is full. Pick a substance where the energy band
   from valence->condcting bands is low, and can be excited there by visible
   light. Once there are some empty spots in those bands, electrons are free
   to hop along--we have turned the material into a conductor.

Semiconductor
 - Doping a conducting material with neutral-type material "removes" some
   electrons from the valence band into the conducting band.
 - P-type: holes in valence.
 - N-type: holes in conducting band; "a few too many electrons"

Putting the two together makes a PN Junction.
- Layer between the two types where electrons transfer--one side becomes
  slightly positive, one side becomes slightly negative. This creates an
  electric field, as well as a little insulating region where the conducting
  band is completely empty and valence band is completely full.
- Putting electrons through the junction from right to left still conducts.
  They hop along and then hop down across the insulating region, from the
  conducting band to teh valence band.
- From the left, electrons simply fill up the valence band, and get
  stuck--current doesn't conduct (electron current, not conventional current)
- This creates a diode--electricity flows one day but not the other.
- Note: N-type and P-type doping barely changes the material. Maybe 1 in a
  million atoms.

Power Supplies
 - AC in on side, into a spiral (2 wires).
 - Wire, veritcal
 - Coil on other side (two wires--one grounded, diode on the other)
   - Diode: |>| "triangle pointing in the direction of conventional current"
 - From these two wires, attach a large enough capacitor, which picks up the
   strictly-positive bumps of voltage and smooths it out.
 - Q: Why does coil whine happen? A: The coil vibrates as the AC varies, due to
   the changing electric field, which causes a buzzing sound.
   - TVs whine because the steering coils do this.

LEDs
 - Semiconducting material where the band gap in the PN junction is just the
   right distance to produce a visible photon as the electrons hop down.
 - Infrared used to be the easiest to make. We can't see that wavelength.
   - Old cameras lack infrared filters. Newer cameras (i.e. our phones) don't
     pick up on infrared.
 - Infrared < Red < Green < Blue (power levels)
**Demo:** 4 of these LEDs attached to a variable power supply. IR comes on first,
then red, etc.

Solar Cell
 - P-type, n-type material with depletion region between them
 - energy of light increases the energy of electrons, and the work done creates
   a current

Why is the sky blue (and sunset red)?
 - Rayleigh scattering: Light tends to scatter off of small particles in air.
   Blue light tends to scatter more than red. Shorter wavelength scatters more
   than longer ones. (Wavelengths closest to the size of the atoms tend to
   scatter most, so blue, since it's the smallest.)
 - Blue light gets scattered by atmosphere. So the sky is blue.
 - When looking directly at the sun, during sunset, blue light gets scattered
   away, and red light makes it to us.

**Demo:** "A sunset"
 - Water and pinesol in a thin fish tank thing.
 - Laser pointer bounces. "Different mediums can act like prisms, or mirrors,
   depending on the angle."
 - Shining white light (a flash light), blue gets scattered, and it looks like
   a sunset orange-red on the other side.

What colours are the stars? White.
What colour is the sun? Yellow.
Why?
 - Actually yellow light from the sun, because it's strong enough to trigger
   the colour sensors in our eyes. Far away stars don't so our eyes see white.

Rainbows?
 - Sun behind you, rain in front.
 - Refraction (like prism) through raindrops, and reflection off opposite side
   of raindrop.
 - Higher drops send red into your eye. Lower drops send blue.
 - Every raindrop does this. But the sun sends parallel sheets of light toward
   you. You only see red from drops at a certain angle, etc. "Only some of it
   goes into your eye, like a screen."


## Lecture 19
**Demo:** Foot-pump "rocket" thing.
Q: Is this a rocket?
A: No. Air propels it form the ground, but no mass continues to exit it, so
   it's more akin to a projectile.

Nuclear Physics

Chemical Energy vs Nuclear Energy
 - Chemical energy comes from bonds being broken

Particles in the Atom
- Proton: positive charge, mass of hydrogen nucleus
- Neutron: no charge, mass close to proton
- Electron: negative charge, mass 1/2000 that of a proton
- Nucleus consists of nucleus and electrons.
- Atom consists of nucleus and electrons.
- Neutral atoms have num(electrons)==num(protons)
- Chemical properties are given by the number of protons in the atom (numbers
  on the periodic table)

Hydrogen
- Nucleus consists of 1 proton; atom consists of 1 proton and 1 electron
- Different isotopes, with different numbers of neutrons, different masses, but
  same chemical properties (hard to tell them apart)
  - Deutrium (^2 H): 1p + 1e + 1n
  - Tritium (^3 H):  1p + 1e + 2n
  - ^1 H is stable, whereas other isotopes are radioactive (we'll cover this
    later)

The Nucleus
- Neutrons and Protons
- Electric forces try to rip the nucleus apart
- Strong nuclear force keeps the nucleus together (much stronger than the
  electrostatic force at small distances)
- We need some neutrons in our atom to hold the nucleus with this new kind of
  force
  "Neutrons by themselves are unstable."

Einstein
- E=mc^2
  "Mass and energy are the exact same thing." 
- A gram of mass is 10^14 joules (lift 1kg 1m in the air; moving car = 500J)
  "A billion cars" "insane amount of energy in 1g of mass"

Nuclear Fission
- Neutron collides with a nucleus and breaks the nucleus apart, forming fission
  products and free neutrons and energy.
- The energy is stored electrostatic force required to assemble the nucleus
  (charged particles fly away from each other).
- Different mass of products after fission tells us how much energy was
  released.

**FINAL: Review half-life, it was touched on briefly but isn't on the slides?
- Resulting nuclear waste is radioactive
- Unstable atoms decay naturally--half life is how long it takes for unstable
  mass to decrease by 50% 

**Demo:** Old, tube-powered geiger counter + Cesium.
- Single stray particles flying through two plates causes a cascade of charges
  between the plates, causing current to flow through a connected speaker cone.

Old watches also have radium to glow in the dark, and smoke detectors also use
nuclear material.

Chain Reactions
- If there is enough surrounding material, decaying neutrons will run into
  them, causing more fission. If there is enough mass (critical mass) the chain
  reaction sustains due to neutrons being kept inside.

Nuclear Fusion
e.g. Deutrium + Tritium => Helium + neutron + energy
"Energy is released when we fuse materials together."
- Helium nucleus and neutron fly apart at incredible speed because so much
  energy is released.
- Enormous amount of energy needed to force the protons together.

Risks Associated with Radiation
"I used to have radiation training done at Argon National Labs."
Activities with 1 chance in 1000000 of dying.
- Smoking 1.4 cigarettes
- Eating 40 tbsp of peanut butter
- Eating 100 charcoal-broiled steaks
- Spending 2 days in NYC (air pollution)
- Driving 40 miles in a car
- Paddling a canoe for 6 miles
- Receiving 1-mrem radiation dose (cancer)

Table 2 - Average Loss of Life Expectancy
- Radation dose of 100 mrem/year for 70 years = -10 days avg life expectancy
- Drinking coffee: -6 days

Table 3 - Avg Annual Radiation Dose by Occupation
- Industrial radiographer
- Airline attendee

Nuclear Weapons

Uranium
238: Relatively stable, half life of 4.5bil years.
235: Less stable, half life 700mil years, fissions relatively easily
- Critical mmass: 52kg (ball of diameter 17cm)
- Can't create it chemically--hard to separate U235 from U238
- Must use mass-separation techniques (centrifuges)

Fission Bomb (Uranium)
- Two sub-critical masses of U235 combined to make critical mass, quickly.
- Sphere with a part missing; cannon fires remaining mass into sphere
- Uranium contained in tungsten carbide and steel container to contain the
  chain reaction for long enough for the force to become significant

Fission Bomb
- Plutonium very radioactive and chain reaction very easy to start
- Difficult to assemble critical mass enough for a complete explosion ot occur
- Use a subcritical mass of plutonium and implode it with a high explosive
- The Uranium tamper reflected escaping neutrons back into the plutonium
- Chain reaction

Distant Planets and the Search for Life Beyond our Solar System

A Canadian unofficially discovered the first extrasolar planet outside our solar
system, but could not verify it.

We are biased to look for planets like our own.

Why is it hard to find planets like ours?
- It's 109x times smaller than the sun
- It's 300000x smaller in mass
- It's <1 /1000000 the volume of the sun
- When we look up in the sky, we only see stars!

[Diagram: solar system planet orbitals.]

Our solar system is a lot of empty state.

Comet cloud / Oort cloud

[Animation: Relative speed of planets' orbits]
Planets that are closer to the sun move much much faster.

Outermost planets are huge, move slowly.

Other Planetary Systems
- How can we find (tiny) planets in (big) orbits around stars that are far away
  from us? They don't emit light!
- Look at the stars. Planets have an effect on the star they orbit. We have 14
  techniques to do this (but will only discuss 2 today).

[Animation: Pink planet orbiting a yellow star]
Both the sun and the planet orbit around the centre of mass of the system.

When the planet's coming towards us, the star is going away.

Radial velocity can be measured by speed of body moving towards observer (EM
shift).

Black lines are when planet blocks sun (?)

Shifts in lines lets us see the radial velocity.

[Animation: Solar System Barycenter / SSB]

Our sun's (complex) motion around a red diamond (centre of mass), dominated by
Jupiter's orbit.

Radial velocity discoveries of extrasolar planets
- 1992: Wolszczen and Frail; radio observations; two planets in orbit around a
  pulsar (dead star)
- 1995 Mayor and Queloz, planet near G-type star 51 Pegasi (similar to our sun)
- 1996: 2 more planets found, 6 in 1997, 2 in 1998, 6 in 1999, 19 in 2000, ...

One planet did something special: Cross in front of the star, causing the
brightness of the star we see to get slightly fainter.
This is a "transit" orbit.

Kepler launched to look for this star-dimming. No eclipse/transit or partial
transit => can't see any planets.

[Image: Real Kepler satellite data: 1.0000 to 0.9998 brightness!]

Stars can naturally vary in brightness, but usually it's a more complicated
event. This transit behaviour--star getting fainter for a few hours--repeats
itself. If it's an earth-like planet, we can look for the event a year later.
- Less than a year after Kepler's launch, they discovered 5 planets! All with
  orbits <5 days!
- Mostly 14-16 times radius of the Earth; one 4x.
- Stars close in mass to our sun, so these planets are very hot.
- First solar system found by Kepler: Kepler-11 System; all just slightly
  larger than Mercury's orbit.

[Animation: Correct-scale Kepler Orrery IV; "all the planets found by Kepler so
far"]
800 or so are close to Earth

3541 confirmed extrasolar planets (exoplanets)

Is there life on any of these planets?

Where should we look for life?

What does life look like (from here)?

What is life?

Science fiction predicitons of alien organisms
- Humanoid? (not likely)
- Weird dinosaurs
- Giant insects
All of these lifeforms have something in common: they are based on water.
Liquid water.

"I think we will discover microscopic life first--algae!"

Animal life requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide; algae grows easily and
produces oxygen.

Planets with liquid water are those most likely to have life that we could
recognize.

The area around a star where water can exist as a liquid is called the
habitable zone. "Where the temperature is just right--The Goldilocks zone!"

Any closer and it will be steam; and farther and it will be ice.
Larger (bigger, more massive, hotter) stars have bigger habitable zones;
smaller stars have narrower habitable zones.

Kepler-22b is giant in size, so we would think it's gaseus, but it's in the
habitable zone.

Is there life beyond our solar system?

[Graph: Candidates in the habitable zone (NASA/Kepler)]
Maybe 10 candidates for habitable, Earth-sized, potentially liquid water
planets. Larger ones are gas giants--life would look way different.

[Picture: Kepler's small habitable zone planets]
G star brightest > K stars > M stars

Detecting habitable planets around other stars
The spectrum of a planet can tell us if it is habitable.
Earth has unique signature of H2O, low O3 (ozone), and low CO2.
Can't see O2 yet, but ozone hints at O2 creation.


Classic Fermi problem: "How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?" (analogous
to how much life there is in the universe)
- 5 000 000 pop
- 2 people per household
- 1 in 20 households is tuned regularly
...
~125 piano tuners in Chicago!
(Actually 127!)

Drake's equation
- Rate of forming stars
- fraction of stars with planets
- number of planets in habitable zone
- fraction where life developed
- fraction where intelligent life developed (radio astronomy)
- fraction that communicate
- Lifetime of communicating civilization

[Chart: # of civilizations / distance to nearest one from us]
Most optimistic: 10^10/15
One step down: 70 year latency; they are just recieving our first military
radio signals.

SETI
Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence
seti@HOME

Why is interstellar travel difficult?
- We need to make things go 10000 times faster than speed of light! (?)

Where are the aliens?
Possible solutions to Fermi's paradox:
- We are alone
- Civilizations are common, but nobody has colonized the galaxy
- Prime directive: Galactic civilization has deliberately concealed itself from
  us. Stephen Hawking, Canadian National Post, etc.

Where does that leave us?
- There are so many planets now that looks like almost every "normal" star has
  planets.
  - ~95% of stars have planets +/-2
  - Including closest star to us: Proxima Centaurus
- If it is easy for life to start when the conditions are right then there are
  a lot of lifeforms in other solar systems
- If life naturally evolves to intelligence then there will be many
  civilizations near us.

Imagine a science experiment: a box with water, rain, sunlight,
lightning--watch it and see if life evolves.

Earth started out very barron. Lots of lightning and stuff, rain
puddles--exactly that experiment repeated millions of times.


## Lecture 21

**Demo:** Attempt 2 at mousetrap experiement, with more sensitive mousetraps.

Note: We didn't quite have critical mass, because some mousetraps jumped out.
In a critical mass chain reaction, particles stay inside the mass and continue
triggering the explosion.

Recall: Plutonium, fission bomb (Uranium)

Fission bomb - Plutonium
- Subcritical mass of plutonium imploded with a high explosive.
- Encapsulated with Uranium-238, which bounces back neutrons while also getting
  converted into Plutonium when hit, adding to the explosion.

Hydrogen / Thermonuclear / Fusion Bombs
- deuterium + tritium => helium + neutron + energy
- Proton needs a lot of energy to get close to another proton. Do this by
  increasing energy of gaseus deuterium and tritium. When they collide and
  fuse, they release energy.
- Helium nucleus and neutron fly apart at incredible speed because so much
  energy is released.
- Very clean compared to fission bombs that emit various radioactive substances
- Easiest way to make hot enough temperatures is to put a conventional
  Plutonium fission bomb inside of a big U238 container, next to Deutrerium and
  Tritium "salt" (solid). Plutonium can't be too big (subcritical mass) or it
  will explode on its own. Deuterium and Tritium can be in any quantity.
- Plutonium explosion is clean, creates a shockwave, but massive amount of U238
  contaminates all of the surrounding area.

Neutron Bomb
- Like a Hydrogen bomb, but without the U238 casing.
- Considered efficient, because it kills many without contaminating the
  surrounding countryside for 1000s of years.
- Currently outlawed.

Thermal Fission Reactor
- Needs slow assembly of critical mass.
- This is done with a moderator--heavy water (H2O with Deuterium instead of
  Hydrogen). Neutrons lose energy when travelling through this (down to
  "thermal speed").
- We want a *controlled* chain reaction. If it gets out of hand, we insert
  control rods to absorb neutrons and slow/stop the reaction.

Electricity Generation
- Boiling water reactor: reactor core in vat of water, boils, steam runs a
  turbine, exhaust runs through colling tower, pumped back to vat. If the pump
  fails, the vat will over-pressurize and explode! Also, anything in contact
  with the cooling water will be contaminated--radioactive waste.
- Pressurized water reactor: Heat exchanger, reactor side is a full loop of
  water, other side is hooked up to a turbine (not radioactive).

Q: How do we get rid of radioactive waste?
A: Dig a hole, try to encapsulate it so water doesn't run through, and bury it.

Fast Fission Reactor / Breeder Reactor
- No moderator anymore
- Problem: Relative paucity of U235
- Uses highly enriched uranium (25-50%) to maintain chain reaction
- Side effect: fast neutrons are captured by U238 which is then transformed
  into P239.
- Typically cooled with salt.

**Excercise:** 50+ people stand at the front of the room with handfuls of
pingpong balls. Prof throws one ball into the crowd. Each person "reacts" and
throws the pingpong balls in the air when they are hit by a pingpong ball. This
simulates a critical mass/density. To slow down the reaction, we spread out and
do it again. To simulate control rods, we open umbrellas and do it again. To
simulate less control rods, half of us put down the umbrellas.

Walls

Fusion reactions cool rapidly if they are touching the walls of a container, so
we suspend the reactants inside a tokomak donut-shaped thing.

Accidents

Fun fact: Jimmy Carter helped clean up the first nuclear reactor accident in
Canada, Shock River (?).

The first *major* accident was Windscale Pile 1 in Britain (1957). They were
using an air-cooled graphite-moderator reactor. Radiation-heated graphite
formed a crystalline structure, which can strain and store potential energy. So
we must anneal it. But here, a "hot spot" of burning graphite exploded.

Boron tends to absorb neutrons more effectively; can be used for faster plant
shutdowns.

3-Mile Island, Pennsylvania: Pressurized water thermal reactor; water pump
failed in generating loop; reactor shut down with, but fissionable byproducts
continued to generate heat without cooling, and radioactive steam was released.

Chernobyl Reactor Number 4, Ukraine (1986): Water cooled, graphite moderator;
control rods inserted too much during emergency cooling system test slowed the
reactor way down; in manual mode, they withdrew lots of rods to get it going
again; became too hot (partially due to over-moderation with graphite that also
burned), and manually-disabled emergency cooling didn't properly stop the
reaction.

Fukushima Daiichi (2011): Earthquake properly caused shutdown of reactor;
cooling water still being pumped to keep reactor cool while products continued
to decay; on-site generators flooded, stopping pumps, stopping cooling of
reactor core (note that the reactor can't generate electricity when off).
Reactor core then overheated and melted; explosions; spew of radioactive
material into environment.

Next week preview: Making X-rays

When a charged particle accelerates, it emits radiation.

Shooting electrons at a material causes it to bend around the nuclei,
generating an electric field in the form of a photon (particle of light)
depending on speed of electron. Copper and tungsten are good targets for this.

Fluorescence: Electron comes into atom and ejects another, creating an open
spot where another electron can fall in, which emits light.

Interactions of photons

Elastic scattering: Atom absorbs and re-emits an xray (as waves). No energy
lost; waves come in and out elastically.

Photoelectric effect: Incoming xray causes atom to eject an electron.

Compton scattering: Photon comes in and doesn't ocmpletely eject an electron;
electron is ejected, and atom emits another electromagnetic wave. Looks like a
2D momentum diagram! This proves that electromagnetic waves could be particles,
and that these particles with no mass still had momentum.

Electron-Positron Pair Produciton: Put photon near a strong magnetic field
(like near an atom), and the photon can spontaneously split into matter and
antimatter (electron-positron pair). When those two come together they are
annihilated and release energy.


## Lecture 22

X-Rays
- High-energy photons
- Roentgen 1895
- "X" because their nature was unknown
- First clinical use was in 1896 "two month turnaround from discovery to
  practical use"
- Problem: overexposure caused burns (more powerful than UV-ray sunburns)

**Demo:** Thorium piece inside a glass case above an ethanol vapour. Inside the
cloud chamber, you can see trails following each radioactive decayed alpha
particle.

Making X-Rays
- Bremsstrahlung accelerating charge creates photon
  "don't worry about the names"
- Fluorescence / characteristic radiation: high-energy particle ejects a core
  electron; higher-up electron

"anode is piece of metal that you're hitting"
"whir before a click for xrays is a rotating anode spinning up before a shutter
 lets some fly"

- More absorbtion in heavier elements, heavier elements in your bones => bones
  are dark on the xray image
- If a photon has > 1 022 000 eV, it splits into electron-positron pair
- photoelectric effect is dominant--large atoms absorb photons, small atoms let
  them oass through
- elastic scattering contributes to picture fuzziness

Observe: This dental xray.
- Film place in your mouth
- Nowadays, a "storage phospher" is used in place of film

We can't typically see fluid with an xray (not solid enough, like bone, yo
contrast). So we inject patients with iodine dye that shows up.

Computed Tomography (CT) Scan
- Xrays
- Creates 3D image
- looks at slices through the body

Excercise: Have your partner give you the peace sign (two fingers). Close one
eye, have them displace their fingers away/towards you, and your depth
perception doesn't work!

But if you move your head in a circle, you can paint a picture in your mind of
the position of the fingers. That's what a CT scan does.

Video: Visible human cross-sections. "We used to have to cut up dead bodies in
order to get these cross-sections."

Video: bottom-to-top cross sections of a head CT scan. Notice the muscles next
to your eyes at one point, the optic nerve behind your eys at another, etc.

Can be reconstructed to be front-to-back.

Radiation Therapy
- Compton scattering is important
- Need to deposit energy into a tumor (and minimize it everywhere else). To do
  this, we rotate the source around the tumor to minimize damage occuring into
  other parts of your body.
- Energy >1MeV
- Electron-positron annihilation is also important

We want a high-energy photon to hit the body
- We can generate it ourselves, or have natural decay
- Cobalt60 undergoes beta decay, becomes Nickel60 + electron + photon
- Gamma ray (higher power than xray)

Particle Accelerator
- Linear accelerator: series of alternatingly-charged plates with holes in the
  middle; particle flies down the middle, flung through increasingly powerful
  plates
- Large xray generator (synchotron): positron (charged particles) flung around
  a vacuum tube in a ring
  - Alternately, the particles go through "wigglers" (bends in the tube); 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
- Actually nuclear magnetic resonance, but that acronym scared people
- Radio waves hit you, as well as a strong static magnetic field
- Looking at proton (i.e. in Hydrogen around your body)
- Protons are the nucleus inside of a H atom
- Protons have "spin", either spin up or spin down; this is responsible for the
  magnetism of magnetic fields; spin-down points against the magnetic field; in
  a magnetic field, there is an energy difference between spin=up and
  spin-downs, the difference's magnitude changes with the magnitude of the
  magnetic field. Flipping the spin of a proton causes it to lose energy, emit
  a radio wave; measuring the radio wave tells us the strength of the magnetic
  field of where the proton is.
- In an MRI, a big solenoid spins around you, creating a magnetic field
  pointing through the hole. We then slightly alter the field strength
  throughout the chamber, a "magnetic field gradient", changing where we
  recieve radio wave signals from protons. So we can deduce location. Magnetic
  pulses are used to flip protons (low energy, safe for you unless you have
  metal in your pocket).
- Loud banging in machine is mechanical response to large spinning
  magnets--hard to remove.
- Burst flips protons, as they calm down they flip back and emit radio waves.
  Intensity tells us how many there are; frequency tells us where the protons
  are. (?)
- Time to cool down tells us about chemical environment near the protons.
- Great for soft tissue wiht lots of hydrogen in it.
- Gives very detailed images of flesh, with no dye needed!
- Typically doesn't hurt you like xrays, as it's just magnetic field
  interactions (assuming your body is free of magnetic flakes).

Functional MRI (fMRI)
- Give stimulus to brain, look for chemical responses
