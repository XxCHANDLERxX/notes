The Resort, the Safari, and the Village: Global Tourism and Development

What goes into making a place “tourable”?

Land politics, territories

Infrastructure in place

Labour going into making things tourable

Readings: poverty/slums have been designated as tourable - how?

What makes us designate a place as tourable/worth seeing?

Ethical issues regarding entitlement/right to travel somewhere

We will avoid the ethical issues surrounding tourism, but it is a very
interesting discussion topic

What is Tourism?

    Since 1950, 25mil has grown to over 1bil international tourist arrivals
    globally

    45% of tourism market is now shared by emerging/developing countries

    Represents 1 in 11 jobs worldwide

    Downturn/decline of tourism based on local disasters, etc.

    Volatile tourism industry makes for an unstable workforce

Tourism and Development

    Tourism: Passport to Development? (tourism as a means to bootstrap
    development)

    The world bank 60s and 70s financing large-scale resorts and toruism
    constructions in the global south

    Since 1987’s sustainable development model was introduced, we believe that
    present-day development shouldn’t endanger life for future generations

    Millennium development goals (2000-2015), primarily to reduce poverty in
    the world by half

Tourism and Neoliberalism

    UNWTO (World Tourism Organization)

    Tourism is heavily privatized and largely run by private companies, varying
    in size

    International airline companies play a huge role in the tourism sector

    Credit card companies can be members of WTO and make decisions regarding
    tourism

    World Travel and Tourism Council - invite-only council of private companies

    Culture presented in tourism impacts our worldview

Tourism and ‘Othering’

    Presents tourist sites as different from us

    Ranges from harmless stereotyping to deeply-rooted racial discrimination
    used to enforce hierarchies between races, genders, location, etc.
    
    People labelled as dangerous, in need of protection, etc.
    
    Places labelled as “exotic”, “primitive”
    
    e.g. Traditional garb being worn by white tourists doing egyptian walk is
    an oversimplification of deeper, more complex histories and cultures
    
    e.g. “Canibal Tours” - Papua New Guinea natives seen as primitive, less
    human, dangerous, etc.
    
    e.g. Brazilian ads with “exotic”, sexualized women

The Resort

    As a form of tourism, this dates back to the 19th century

    In the global south, it began mainly in the late 20th century during the
    global push for tourism development

    e.g. Resorts/toursim in Mexico actually makes up the third largest income
    sector (behind oil and remittances); Acapulco in 1950s and Cancun in 1960s

    How Resorts are Made Possible

        Demand for jobs and migration (especially to places outside of major
        capitals),
    
        Presentation of culture (in food, attire; often superficial things from
        the past rather than accurate, modern portrayals)
    
        Land (which must be purchase, maintained; recently Mexico changed laws
        so that foreign investors can more easily buy land); a lot of resources
        used within resorts are often scarce outside the resort; waste from
        resorts are often strewn outside the resort; resorts are often heavily
        securitized, fenced off, protected by tourist police officials - often
        discriminating, e.g. against Haitian individuals

    Reasoning behind this discussion: how are resorts (especially in Mexico)
    known as violent places?
    
    Much of the load of running a resort is pushed on the local population
    
    Not the result of individual tourists/locals, but the result of the way
    resorts are structured to pull in resources and place negative consequences
    on the local population.

The Safari (Conservation Site)

    Often in areas where people live

    Conservation linked to “land-grabbing” - privatizing large amounts of lands
    for safaris/making money

    Criticized for commodifying nature/land to sell to visiting tourists

    Often involves a view that “healthy” land is land without humans living
    there

    This negatively impacts natives

    e.g. The Maasai

        This started as early British coloniasts seeing Maasai as a neusance;
        an impediment to national development

        Between Kenya and Tanzania

        Nomadic people, but were forcibly moved into particular locations

        Introduction of anti-poaching legislation in 1989

        Maasai had to hunt in national park areas due to poor land in
        designated reserves

        Introduced shoot-to-kill policy on poachers; killed hundreds of Maasai
        people

        Law was eventually repealed

    Mass expanses of natural land is actually peoples’ homes!

The Village - Alternative Tourism

    Pro-poor tourism; reducing poverty is a key aim (Millenium Development
    Goals)

    Community-based
    
    Usually caters to smaller numbers of tourists, mitigating the large-scale
    negative impacts of things like resorts
    
    Key negative impacts remain
    
        high volatility of tourism leads to volatile/unsustainable
        small-community income
    
        reducing a group of diverse people to a “community” isn’t always
        optimal; can ignore existing social structures and power dynamics that
        should be taken into account

    Voluntourism - travelling somewhere as a tourist but participating in some
    sort of development/volunteer activity; seen as “giving back” quells a lot
    of the above concerns
        
        a very lucrative business; a lucrative part of the tourism industry
    
        trips can cost thousands of dollars - mostly going towards the agencies
    
        now there is pressure on all tourist companies to provide volunteer
        opportunities
    
        2016 carnival cruise line ship - volunteer activity cruises
        
        commonly critiqued
    
            it puts the onus on development on short-term travel experiences,
            and has no relation to long-term development
    
            can potentially take jobs away from local residents
    
            often accused of being mostly about making tourists feel better
            about themselves
    
            hogs a lot of resources to bring in a voluntourist that could be
            used instead
    
            doesn’t address global inequalities
    
            ends up being bad for everyone involved - the structure of how it
            is organized makes it impossible for the advertised changes to
            actually happen - voluntourists, however genuine, become frustrated
            because the change they bring about are shallow
    
    Slum tourism “slumming”
    
        Over 800mil live in slums in the global south

        Often where people migrating from rural to city end up after not
        finding good jobs
        
        Also historical - happened in the 19th century
       
        Starts as political awareness, but ends up being a commodification of
        poverty as a cultural difference to be explored
       
        Slums become seen as local problems to be solved, rather than an
        analysis of global trade/resource/economic development disparities
       
        Reduces structural problems onto the individual
